/**
 * Platform mail — the sender behind escalation email (spec §5.3).
 *
 * This module exists because the previous implementation reported success for
 * mail it never sent. `enqueue("email-send", …)` resolved against a queue with
 * no worker, so `error_escalation_log` recorded `email: [recipients]` for a page
 * nobody received. "Why was I not called at 3am" had a confident, false answer.
 *
 * So the assertions that matter here are NEGATIVE and they are about HONESTY:
 * every failure path must return `ok:false` with a reason the operator can act
 * on, and none of them may throw — because the caller is the escalation
 * evaluator, where a raised exception would also cancel the in-house
 * notification and the webhook for the same incident.
 *
 * The clash risk is covered too. doc/EMAIL_TWO_CONFIGS.md defines exactly two
 * email configurations; this must remain a second CONSUMER of System email's
 * fallback tier rather than becoming a third config with its own transport.
