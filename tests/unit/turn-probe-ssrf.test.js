 * The relay host is operator-supplied: it comes from the platform console's

 * send a UDP packet to a name somebody typed, and without a guard that is a
 * port scanner with a button — point it at 169.254.169.254 and read whether
 * cloud metadata answers.
 *
 * The ranges refused here are the ones coturn's own entrypoint denies as
 * peers (calls audit C1). The two lists are deliberately the same shape: the
 * relay must not reach the host's private services, and neither must the
 * thing that tests the relay.
