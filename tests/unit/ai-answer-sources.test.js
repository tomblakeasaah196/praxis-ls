/**
 * The grounding an answer actually stands on.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS PINNED HARD. Three UI surfaces — the Sources tab, the Record tab
 * and the footer under every reply — render only when `/ai/ask` returns
 * `sources`, and they had never rendered because nothing populated it. A
 * regression here does not throw and does not look broken: the footer simply
 * stops appearing, and an accounting assistant quietly loses the ability to show
 * its working. Same shape of failure `client/src/components/ai/grounding.test.ts`
 * was written to catch on the other side of the wire.
 *
 * DB-free: everything under test is pure, taking the read results the
 * orchestrator already holds.
