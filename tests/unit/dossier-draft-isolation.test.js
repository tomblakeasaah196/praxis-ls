/**
 * A DRAFT must not leak into anything that enumerates operations files.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A BUILD GATE AND NOT A CODE-REVIEW ITEM
 *
 * The creation wizard opens a DRAFT dossier so that documents can be attached
 * before the file is finished — uploads need a real `dossier_id`, and the
 * alternative (legacy's) is that nobody uploads anything at creation. The cost
 * is that a half-typed form is now a row in `dossier`, and forty-three queries
 * across nineteen files read that table: lists, the Control Tower, dashboards,
 * KPI counts, the client portal, milestone SLA sweeps, AI knowledge cards.
 *
 * Auditing those once would have worked on the day it was done and rotted on
 * the first query written afterwards — and the failure is silent. Nobody
 * notices a board report counting four phantom files; they notice it a quarter
 * later and cannot explain it.
 *
 * So the exclusion is a VIEW (`dossier_visible`, migration 0671) and this test
 * inverts the burden: reading the BASE table is the thing that has to be
 * justified, one entry at a time, with a reason. A new enumerating query that
 * forgets fails here, at the moment it is written, with the fix in the message.
 *
 * WHAT COUNTS AS A LEGITIMATE BASE-TABLE READ
 *
 * Fetching a KNOWN dossier_id. You cannot reach a draft you were not given the
 * id of, and the wizard has to be able to read and write its own. Everything
 * else — anything that could return a row the caller did not already name — is
 * an enumeration, and belongs on the view.

/**
 * Base-table reads that are correct, and why.

 * entry is a deliberate act: if you cannot write the reason, the query probably
