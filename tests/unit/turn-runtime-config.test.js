/**
 * The call relay, half in the vault and half on the host.
 *
 * `.env` holds thirteen TURN_* variables, read by two different programs. The
 * API reads the host, ports and transports to build the `iceServers` array a
 * browser is handed — a description, which can live in a database. coturn
 * reads the realm, the IPs, the certificate paths and the port range from a
 * file it renders once at start — bindings, which a console cannot change.
 *
 * These tests hold that line. The interesting cases are not "the vault wins"
 * but the three where it must NOT:
 *
 *   - the TLS and UDP ports, because they are coturn's listeners as well as
 *     part of the URL we advertise, and a settable copy would let the console
 *     advertise a port nothing is listening on;
 *   - the shared secret, because the API signs with it and coturn verifies
 *     with it;
 *   - anything at all when the vault is unreachable, because a platform-DB
 *     hiccup must not take calls down.
