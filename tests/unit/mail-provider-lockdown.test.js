   * written about, and hiding the two buttons in `setup/mailboxes.tsx` was
   * the entire enforcement. A stale tab, a bookmarked
   * `/mail/oauth/google/start`, or a curl walked straight past it.
   *
   * Asserted at BOTH ends on purpose. The start check is what stops a person
   * being sent to Microsoft to consent to something we will refuse; the
   * complete check is what stops a state token minted while the flag was on
   * from landing a mailbox after an administrator turned it off. */
