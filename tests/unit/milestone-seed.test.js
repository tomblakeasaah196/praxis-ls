/**
 * Integrity of the seeded milestone chains (9091).
 *
 * The seed itself raises on a bad weight sum, so a broken chain cannot reach a
 * database. But that check only fires when somebody RUNS the seed against
 * Postgres — which, for a file that is applied once at provisioning, can be a
 * long time after the edit that broke it. This reads the SQL statically so an
 * edit that unbalances a chain fails in the fast suite, next to the change.
 *
 * WHY THE WEIGHTS ARE WORTH A TEST AT ALL. They are the duration model: a
 * segment summing to 97 instead of 100 silently shortens every forecast on that
 * service by 3%, on every dossier, forever. It produces no error and no
 * complaint — just dates that are quietly wrong, which is the failure mode this
 * whole engine exists to remove.
