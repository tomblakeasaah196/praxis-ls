/**
 * TC-C1 — multi-tenant isolation. `registry.service.js` had 0 of 10 functions
 * covered.
 *
 * This module is the tenant boundary. It turns a Host header into a database,
 * and every request in the product goes through it. A defect here is not a bug
 * in a feature; it is one tenant reading another tenant's books. It was also
 * the least tested file in the codebase.
 *
 * WHAT IS ACTUALLY ASSERTED
 *
 * Not "does it return a pool" — the isolation properties, stated as things that
 * must never happen:
 *
 *   - two tenants must never share a pool, whatever order they arrive in
 *   - a connection must never be handed out bound to the wrong schema
 *   - a cached host must never resolve to a different tenant's metadata
 *   - an unbounded input must never grow an unbounded cache (PERF S10)
 *   - eviction must never drop a pool that is still the most recently used
 *
 * `pg` is mocked because the point is the registry's own logic; a real Postgres
 * would test Postgres. The fake Pool records every connection it hands out so
 * the tests can assert on identity, not just on shape.
 *
 * jest.mock is called before the module under test is required, and the module
 * is required lazily in beforeEach. That ordering is not stylistic: it is what
 * lets these tests run under a plain-node runner as well as under Jest.
