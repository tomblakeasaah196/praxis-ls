       * This line used to be `return { rows: [] }`, which made the fake
       * incapable of noticing anything: a wrong WHERE clause, a dropped
       * tenant/entity filter, a changed column list, or a query that was never
       * issued at all, each arrived as "no rows" and the test carried on to
       * assert something else. The comment eleven lines above is the proof — a
       * real query-shape change (S20's identifier quoting) turned into "Invoice
       * not found", and the fake said nothing.
       *
       * An empty result is a LEGITIMATE ANSWER to some queries and a SILENT
       * FAILURE for the rest, and a catch-all cannot tell them apart. So the
       * catch-all is gone: every query this service issues must be matched
       * above, and adding one to the service means adding it here. That is the
       * cost, and it is the point — it is what makes the fake disagree with a
       * change instead of absorbing it.
       *
       * Adapted from tests/unit/wms-inventory.test.js, where writing a strict
       * fake caught two genuine mismatches during authoring. This is still a
       * fake and still cannot prove the SQL is CORRECT — only a real database
       * does that (TC-C6, and the integration job now runs one). What it can do
       * is stop being confidently wrong.
