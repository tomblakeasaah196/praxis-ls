/**
 * The metric-matched fallback faces (guide O-12 / F-33).
 *
 * ── WHAT MAKES A HARDCODED METRIC HONEST ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * F-33 declined to fix the font reflow because the number it could measure came
 * from one container's `sans-serif`, and a visitor's fallback is Arial on
 * Windows, Helvetica on macOS and Roboto on Android. That objection is right
 * about a MEASURED constant and wrong about the fix: what a fallback face needs
 * is the metrics of a specific named font, and those are properties of that
 * font rather than of the machine measuring it.
 *
 * So `gen-font-fallbacks.mjs` carries a small table, and this file is what stops
 * the table being remembered numbers:
 *
 *   · OUR faces are read from the real `.woff2` in `node_modules`, so nothing
 *     about them is typed at all.
 *   · The FALLBACK metrics are verified against a real font file wherever the
 *     machine running this has one. Liberation Sans is metric-compatible with
 *     Arial BY DESIGN — Red Hat built it as a drop-in with identical advance
 *     widths and identical vertical metrics — and Arial is metric-compatible
 *     with Helvetica. One file therefore pins the numbers for the whole family.
 *
 * On a machine without those files the verification SKIPS rather than passes:
 * see the note on `describeIfFonts`.

/**
 * ── WHY THIS BLOCK IS CONDITIONAL, AND WHY THAT IS NOT A HOLE ─────────────
 *
 * These read the real `.woff2` out of `@fontsource-variable/*`, which are
 * `public-web`'s dependencies and nobody else's. This suite runs under jest at
 * the repo ROOT, and CI's `build-test` job installs the root workspace only —
 * there is no `public-web/node_modules` in it at all. So the block passed
 * locally, where both trees happen to be installed, and failed in CI with four
 * "Cannot resolve module" errors.
 *
 * That is F-44's asymmetry again, pointing the other way: F-44 was public-web
 * reaching for a root package, this is a root test reaching for public-web's.
 * Neither is visible to a local `npm run ci`, which installs everything.
 *
 * The guard is NOT the F-27 failure this file warns about two blocks down. What
 * makes a skip dishonest is that nothing else checks the thing; here something
 * does, and it is stricter. `check:fonts-fallback` — gate 37, in the public-web
 * job, where these packages are always installed — runs `gen-font-fallbacks.mjs
 * --check`, which REGENERATES the stylesheet from these same files through this
 * same `readFaceMetrics` and fails on any difference. It cannot pass without
 * reading them, so "were the metrics actually read" is enforced there whether
 * this block runs or not.
 *
 * What is genuinely conditional is the Inter-versus-Arial assertion below: it
 * runs on a developer's machine and in any job that installs public-web, and it
 * does not run in `build-test`. It is a statement about why the fix exists
 * rather than about whether it works, so that placement is acceptable — the
 * behaviour it explains is pinned by the generator.

 * ── THE COPY IN public-web, PINNED TO THE REGISTRY THAT OWNS IT ───────────
 *
 * `public-web/src/lib/site-theme.ts` hardcodes the four `font-family` stacks
 * rather than calling `siteFontStack()`, because `public-web` does not depend on
 * `@praxis/shared` and D-1 spent real effort keeping it that way. A copy with no
 * check is a copy that drifts, and the drift is invisible: a stack naming a
 * family no `@font-face` declares falls silently through to the generic and
 * looks fine to anybody who has that font installed (F-11).
 *
 * The check lives HERE rather than in that app's own suite, and that placement
 * is the finding. The vitest version imported `@praxis/shared/design/site-fonts`
 * directly, which passed locally — the root workspace hoists the package into a
 * `node_modules` public-web can see — and failed in CI, where that app's job
 * installs only its own declared dependencies. Green by accident is worse than
 * red: it is a test asserting against a module the app does not have.
 *
 * At the repo root the package genuinely resolves, so this compares the real
 * `siteFontStack()` against the TEXT of the file holding the copy. Reading it as
 * text rather than importing it is what keeps a TypeScript module out of a jest
 * run, and it is enough: the thing being protected is a string literal.
