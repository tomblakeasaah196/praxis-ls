/**
 * The costing sheet as a DOCUMENT — what it must say, and what it must not.
 *
 * WHAT THESE PIN, and why each is a defect that has already happened once.
 *
 * 1. THE DOC TYPE IS REGISTERED. `COSTING` had a template and a projection and
 *    was never in `DOC_TYPES`, so `assertDocType` threw 422 UNKNOWN_DOC_TYPE
 *    and `document_vault.capture()` refused it: the sheet could be previewed
 *    and printed and could never be FILED. Nothing failed loudly — the capture
 *    is best-effort at every call site — so no approved costing in any tenant
 *    has a vault copy of what was approved. A registry test is the only thing
 *    that keeps that from coming back.
 *
 * 2. NO RAW ENUM ON A4. The legacy sheet printed `SUBMITTED_FOR_VALIDATION` at
 *    a person. Statuses leave the rules as a {fr, en} pair and the template
 *    picks a side.
 *
 * 3. VAT IS AN AMOUNT, AND A DÉBOURS SAYS WHY IT HAS NONE. The legacy column
 *    was a percentage, so a mispriced line could only be found with a
 *    calculator; and its VAT box defaulted to ticked, which is how its sample
 *    sheet charges 19.25% VAT on a customs duty.
 *
 * 4. UPSTREAM VAT IS DISCLOSED AND IN NO TOTAL. The Maersk case: we pay
 *    119,250, we re-bill 119,250, and the 19,250 inside it was never ours.
 *
 * 5. THE EQUIPMENT IS IN THE DESCRIPTION. Demurrage is one line per container
 *    type, so without it the sheet prints "Demurrage" twice with two different
 *    amounts and no way to tell which box is which.
 *
 * 6. THE SEAL ATTESTS TO THE BUDGET. Line identity in the canonical payload
 *    includes the container type, and nature includes `is_disbursement` —
 *    editing either after approval must invalidate the seal.
 *
 * Every assertion reads the OUTPUT of the template or the RETURN of a pure
 * function. Reading the plumbing is what let an unregistered doc type survive.
