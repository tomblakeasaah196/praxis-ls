/**
 * TC-C5 and TC-Q4 — the money path, tested without mocking the money away.
 *
 * TC-C5: the money services had 0% function coverage; only the rules layer was
 * tested. TC-Q4 is sharper and explains why the first was easy to miss:
 * `final-invoice-lifecycle.test.js` DOES exercise the invoice lifecycle, but it
 * mocks `determination` and `journal_entry.service`, so the two things that
 * decide what hits the ledger are replaced by fixtures. It asserts the
 * lifecycle transitions correctly and asserts nothing about the accounting.
 *
 * That test is not wrong — a lifecycle test should mock the ledger. What was
 * missing is the other half, and this is it: `determination.compute` run for
 * real, against OHADA account codes, with the arithmetic checked to the centime.
 *
 * WHY THE CENTIME MATTERS ENOUGH TO TEST
 *
 * `compute` works in integer cents and converts back at the edges. That is the
 * correct design and it is also the one that fails invisibly: a rounding error
 * does not throw, it produces an entry that is off by 0.01 and still balances,
 * or one that does not balance and is rejected by a trigger hours later during
 * posting. Neither says "rounding" anywhere.
 *
 * The balance assertion is the load-bearing one. `assert_entry_balanced` in the
 * database is the final authority, but it fires at INSERT time — by then the
 * caller is mid-transaction and the failure surfaces as a 500 from deep inside
 * a posting. Catching it here is the difference between a failing test and a
 * failed invoice.
