/**
 * ── THE ANONYMOUS SURFACE, AND WHY THERE IS EXACTLY ONE ────────────────────
 *
 * This guard's whole value is that it fails when somebody ships a tenant module
 * without auth. The moment a legitimate exception exists, the guard is one
 * `.filter()` away from becoming decoration — so the exception is a NAMED
 * ALLOW-LIST with three properties, all asserted below:
 *
 *   1. Adding a module to it is a deliberate, reviewable edit to this file.
 *   2. A STALE entry fails, so deleting a public module cannot leave a hole
 *      that a future module could silently occupy by taking its name.
 *   3. An allow-listed module must carry a RATE LIMITER on every route. Auth is
 *      not merely absent there, it is REPLACED — a public write endpoint with no
 *      limiter is the actual vulnerability this exception could introduce, and
 *      it is worth more than the auth check it is standing in for.
 *
 * `hr/careers` is the public job-adverts page. It cannot be authenticated by
 * construction: the people using it do not have accounts, and the whole point is
 * that strangers can read a vacancy and apply to it. Its compensating controls
 * live in careers.service (responses are built from an allow-list, never a row;
 * lookup is by minted token only, never by vacancy_id; every refusal is the same
 * 404 so nothing can be enumerated) and careers.validator (every field bounded).

/**
 * TC-Q6 — this guard is the right instinct with two ways of passing while
 * checking nothing. Both are closed here.
 *
 * 1. IT MATCHED BY FUNCTION NAME (`l.name === "authMiddleware"`). Rename the
 *    function, or wrap it in `asyncHandler` — which is a normal thing to do to
 *    an async middleware and would change `.name` to "" or to the wrapper's —
 *    and every assertion below keeps passing while detecting nothing at all.
 *    The guard would report a fully-authenticated surface on the day the whole
 *    surface went anonymous.
 *
 *    It now compares against the IMPORTED FUNCTION REFERENCE. A rename cannot
 *    fool identity, and a wrapper is caught by the second check below rather
 *    than silently accepted.
 *
 * 2. THE FLOOR WAS `> 50` WHILE DISCOVERY RETURNS ~100. If module loading broke
 *    and found 51, the suite stayed green and the other 49 routers went
 *    unchecked — the failure mode being guarded against (a module with no auth)
 *    is indistinguishable from the module not being looked at. The floor is now
 *    pinned near the real count, so losing modules fails loudly.
 *
 * WHAT THIS STILL DOES NOT PROVE, stated because the audit was right to say so:
 * it proves the middleware is MOUNTED, never that it REJECTS anything. That is
 * middleware-chain.test.js's job (TC-C12), and neither test substitutes for the
 * other. It is also per-ROUTER, not per-ROUTE: a router with one gated route and
 * several ungated ones still passes. Closing that is SEC-L5, and it wants the
 * same effective-middleware walk as API-F23 — see handoff §15.
