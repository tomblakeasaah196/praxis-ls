/**
 * OBS-E1 (no centralised error tracking) and OBS-E2 (frontend errors
 * completely invisible) — both Critical, both closed by one sink.
 *
 * Before this, a 500 produced a log line on a box whose logs are not shipped
 * and are wiped on every deploy, and a browser exception produced nothing at
 * all. "What broke this week" was unanswerable.
 *
 * The assertions that matter most are the NEGATIVE ones. An alert channel that
 * fires on 404s, or floods on a render loop, gets muted within a week — and a
 * muted channel is indistinguishable from the state we started in. Dedupe, the
 * rate ceiling, and "4xx must never page anyone" are the difference between
 * error tracking and noise.
