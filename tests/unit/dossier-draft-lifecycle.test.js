/**
 * The creation wizard's lifecycle: open a draft, promote it, sweep what was
 * abandoned.
 *
 * WHAT THESE PIN, and why each one matters more than it looks:
 *
 *   - A DRAFT burns no ref. Our refs are sequential and people reconcile
 *     against them, so a gap is a question somebody has to answer. Legacy's
 *     random 7-digit refs hid that; ours would not.
 *   - A DRAFT fires no `dossier.created`. That event instantiates the milestone
 *     chain and is what the orchestration layer listens to — firing it at draft
 *     time schedules work against a file that may never open.
 *   - Promotion is where required fields are enforced. Enforcing them at draft
 *     time would defeat the entire point of a wizard whose second step is where
 *     they get filled in.
