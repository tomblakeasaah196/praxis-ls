 * Structural guard: every route that hands out or guesses a credential is rate

 * Audit SEC-C3 (2026-08-04). Before this, `forgot-password` and
 * `reset-password` were limited and `/login`, `/refresh`, `/2fa/verify` and
 * `/pin/login` were not — across all THREE auth tiers. The recovery surface was
 * defended and the front door was open, on staff, platform and the
 * internet-facing customer portal alike.
 *
 * The failure this test exists to catch is not "someone deletes a limiter". It
 * is "someone adds a fifth way to obtain a token and doesn't think about it" —
 * which is how the first four came to be unprotected.
 *
 * Asserts against the live Express stack rather than the source text, and
 * detects limiters by the `praxisRateLimit` tag rather than by function name,
 * because express-rate-limit returns an anonymous function. A control the test
 * cannot see is a control the test cannot defend.
