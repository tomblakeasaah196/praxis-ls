/**
 * Frozen inputs for the canonical-payload golden-digest test.
 *
 * ⚠ NEVER EDIT A FIXTURE to make a failing test pass. The digest changing is the
 *   test doing its job: it means a payload builder changed shape, and every
 *   signature ever issued against that doc type has just stopped verifying.
 *   See tests/unit/signature-canonical.test.js for what to do instead.
 *
 * Values are deliberately awkward — trailing-decimal money, three-decimal
 * quantities, accented text, an empty line array — because the rounding and
 * string coercion in canonical.js are part of the hashed contract, and a
 * fixture of round numbers would not exercise them.
