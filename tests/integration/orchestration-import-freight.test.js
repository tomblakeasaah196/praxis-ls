/**
 * DB-backed proof of the orchestration outbox (Plan A) on the import-freight lane
 * (A7 #1). Walks: won opportunity → (dispatcher) opens & links a dossier →
 * approve a costing — and proves the whole thing is idempotent (re-dispatch
 * creates nothing new).
 *
 * THE LANE STOPS AT THE COSTING (12766). It used to end at "a DRAFT final
 * invoice appears for the dossier", asserted here both as a synchronous handoff
 * and as an idempotent async backstop. Both paths are gone: a costing is a
 * BUDGET raised by an operations officer, the final invoice is raised by a
 * finance officer from the accepted quotation, and a document that silently
 * creates another department's document is a control weakness rather than a
 * convenience.
 *
 * The test is INVERTED rather than deleted, and that is the point of keeping
 * it: this is the only place the decoupling is proved against a real database
 * end to end. `costing-foundation.test.js` proves the code does not CALL the
 * invoice module; this proves nothing downstream — no handler, no trigger, no
 * chain — quietly opens one anyway.
 *
 * Skipped unless DATABASE_URL points at a migrated+seeded tenant schema with at
 * least one corporate_entity.
 *   DATABASE_URL    postgres connection string (search_path = the tenant schema)
 *   TEST_ENTITY_ID  a corporate_entity id (guarantees the dossier-ref allocation
 *                   + numbering have an entity to work with)
