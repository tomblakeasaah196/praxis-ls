/**
 * The financial dictionary's price, codes and carrier rates against a real
 * schema (tenant review "meeting 5", 21 Sep 2026):
 *
 *   - a price typed in the create wizard becomes the item's STANDARD expense
 *     rate, and every read (get, list, search, costing's hand-picked line)
 *     reports that rate as `default_price` — the column is never written;
 *   - changing an item's direction moves its code to the new letter's lowest
 *     free number, and the number it gave back is the next one minted;
 *   - "apply to all carriers" supersedes every ticked carrier's series in one
 *     transaction, and one refusal saves none of them.
 *
 * The service commits its own transactions, so the rows it makes are removed
 * afterwards. Runs only with DATABASE_URL pointing at a provisioned tenant;
 * self-skips otherwise, like every suite in this directory.
