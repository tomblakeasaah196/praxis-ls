/**
 * THE PORTAL'S WIRING, ASSERTED AS SOURCE.
 *
 * doc/SIGNATURE_ENGINEERING_GUIDE.md §5.2, §5.8.
 *
 * Every claim here is about something that cannot be observed by calling the
 * service: whether the ROUTE is pinned to live, whether a limiter is MOUNTED,
 * whether a deleted mechanism is really gone from the tree. Each has a failure
 * mode that is invisible in a passing unit test and expensive in production:
 *
 *   · `req.tenantDb` instead of `req.tenantDbIn("live", …)` — an anonymous
 *     visitor sends `X-Praxis-Env: sandbox` and reads the tenant's sandbox
 *     signatures. Verified as a live defect on the proposal endpoint, which is
 *     why that file carries the same pin and the same comment.
 *   · A missing limiter — `verify_code` is 2^60 and stored in plaintext, so the
 *     limiter is the SOLE defence against enumeration (§3.7). It is
 *     load-bearing, not decoration.
 *   · A surviving prefix match — `stored.startsWith(hash)` on a 4-character
 *     floor is sixteen bits, against a public endpoint.
 *
 * Source-reading tests are the right shape for these: the assertion is "the
 * wiring is present", and wiring is what a refactor silently removes.
