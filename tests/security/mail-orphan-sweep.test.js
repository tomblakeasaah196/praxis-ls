/**
 * The second sweep: things that were still declared and not called.
 *
 * The first QC pass fixed the big three. A second pass over the same question —
 * *what did a migration create, or a module export, that nothing reaches?* —
 * turned up five more, four of them shipped by the mega-commit and one
 * introduced by the first pass itself. This file is the regression net for all
 * five, plus the standing gate that stops the class recurring.
 *
 *   1. `email_attachment.checksum_sha256` was written on the OUTBOUND path and
 *      left null on ingest, so the archive chain's "headers + body + attachment
 *      hashes" covered the covering letter and not the invoice.
 *   2. `mailbox.service.offboardUser` — written, idempotent, audited, and called
 *      by nothing, so a suspended user kept every shared-mailbox grant.
 *   3. `signature.repo.deleteCachedForIdentity` — no caller, so the corporate
 *      block on system mail never re-rendered after the company changed.
 *   4. `mailbox.repo.sweepSendWindows` — no caller, so throttle counters grew
 *      without bound.
 *   5. The first pass's own `stampVerdict` read the party corpus PER MESSAGE.
