/**
 * A FLAG A TENANT CANNOT BE GIVEN IS A FEATURE NOBODY HAS.
 *
 * ── THE FINDING ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Migration 10730 seeds fifteen `mail.*` rows into every tenant's
 * `feature_state`, all 'off'. Every mail surface is gated on them —
 * `requireFeature` is mounted in FRONT of each router by `module-loader.js` and
 * has no bypass, not even for the CEO.
 *
 * None of those keys existed in `platform.feature_catalogue`.
 *
 * `provisioning.projectFeatures()` iterates the CATALOGUE, so it never touched
 * them; `plans.service.reprojectPlan` does the same; no tenant-side route
 * writes `feature_state` at all. There was no supported way to turn the mailbox
 * on — not from the console, not from a plan, not from a tenant screen. Four
 * commits of a programme sat behind a hard 403 with no switch.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS KEEPS HAPPENING ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The two halves live in different databases and are seeded by different files.
 * A tenant migration can add a flag, gate a router on it, ship, and be complete
 * on its own terms — the flag exists, the gate works, the tests pass. The half
 * that makes it switchable is somebody else's file, in the platform DB, and
 * nothing connects them.
 *
 * 9110's own header records the first occurrence: "nine keys below were flipped
 * 'off' -> 'on' because their modules are built and mounted, and leaving them
 * off made 19 modules unreachable for everyone." That was the same defect with
 * the catalogue row present and its default wrong. This is the version where
 * the row is missing entirely, which the console cannot even show.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS GATE READS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Both seed sets, as SQL. No database is involved, because the claim is about
 * what the migrations WILL produce, and the failure is invisible at runtime
 * anyway: a missing catalogue row does not error, it just means a projection
 * that never mentions the key, and a tenant whose flag stays at whatever the
 * tenant-side seed left it.
