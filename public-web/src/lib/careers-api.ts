 * The public careers API — moved from `client/src/lib/careers-api.ts`.

 * at all, so the bug it guarded against (a stray 401 firing the session-death
 * signal and throwing a stranger out of a job advert into a staff sign-in
 * screen) cannot be reintroduced here.
 *
 * The tenant is resolved server-side from `Host`, exactly as for the app — so a
 * careers link is this workspace's own domain and carries no slug.
