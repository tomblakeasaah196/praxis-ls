/**
 * ── EVERY SCRUB MUST FINISH WHILE ITS CONTENT IS STILL ON SCREEN ──────────
 *
 * `useScrollScrub`'s default range is `start: 1, end: 0` — "begins when the
 * element's top touches the bottom of the screen, ends when its bottom leaves
 * the top". For a band whose last element sits at its own bottom edge, that is
 * a threshold nobody is ever in a position to see.
 *
 * The arithmetic: with range (s, e), `--scrub` reaches 1 when
 *
 *     rect.top = vh·e − height          →  rect.bottom = vh·e
 *
 * So `end` IS the fraction of the viewport at which the element's bottom sits
 * when the scrub completes. At `end: 0` the element's bottom is exactly at the
 * top of the screen — the band has just left. Anything anchored near the end of
 * the scrub arrives, permanently, out of view.
 *
 * §9.1's timeline shipped with the default in its first draft and the 2026 entry
 * reached full opacity at scrollY 2289 with the band at −400..−62. Measured on
 * the built page in a real browser; no arithmetic test caught it, because the
 * arithmetic was right and the GEOMETRY was wrong. This is PR 4's ESG
 * annotation defect in a new shape, and it is the second time the programme has
 * paid for it — hence a test over every call site rather than one more fix.
 *
 * `{ start: 0, end: 1 }` on the insights reading rail is the deliberate
 * exception and is listed with its reason: that scrub is reading PROGRESS over
 * a whole article, where completing as the article's bottom reaches the bottom
 * of the viewport is exactly the meaning.
