/**
 * The public API client — the only way this app talks to the server.
 *
 * ── WHY IT IS NOT `client/src/lib/api-client.ts` ──────────────────────────
 *
 * That client is a session machine. It attaches a Bearer token, sends the
 * `X-Praxis-Env` header, and on a 401 tries one refresh and — when that fails —
 * fires the session-death signal that clears tokens and bounces the user to
 * `/login`. Every one of those behaviours is wrong for a stranger:
 *
 *   · they have no token, so there is nothing to attach and nothing to refresh;
 *   · a public endpoint is pinned to the LIVE schema server-side
 *     (`req.tenantDbIn("live", …)`), so an env header is not just useless, it is
 *     a surface an anonymous caller must not be able to influence;
 *   · the bounce is the bad one. A candidate reading a job advert, or a client
 *     forwarding a proposal link, would be thrown out of a public page into a
 *     STAFF sign-in screen because one fetch answered 401.
 *
 * `client/src/lib/careers-api.ts` documents the same conclusion from the other
 * side (`auth: false` on every call, "not a formality"). This file is that
 * conclusion taken to its end: there is no auth path to opt out of.
 *
 * The tenant is resolved by the backend from the request's `Host` header, so no
 * URL here contains a slug and nothing in the browser needs to know one.
