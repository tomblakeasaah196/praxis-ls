/**
 * The transport modes, as the quote wizard's first question.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS FILE DOES NOT DECIDE WHICH MODES EXIST ───────────────────────
 *
 * It used to. The wizard opened with four cards — Sea / Air / Road-or-rail /
 * Storage — written into the component as a literal, and that was wrong in both
 * directions at once for every tenant: it offered storage to a tenant who does
 * not warehouse, and it had no card at all for a tenant whose business is
 * customs brokerage. A stranger who picks "By sea" on a form belonging to an
 * air-freight-only agent has been invited to describe a shipment nobody there
 * will quote.
 *
 * So the LIST is data — `modesOf` reads it off the tenant's own published
 * services — and this file owns only the two things that are genuinely ours:
 * the glyph, and the order the cards appear in. Those are presentation, and
 * presentation is what a scaffold is allowed to own (`WEB_BUILD_BRIEF.md` N12).
 *
 * ── AND WHY THE ORDER IS FIXED RATHER THAN READ ───────────────────────────
 *
 * `sort_order` on the profile orders SERVICES, not modes, and folding it up
 * would make the first card of the form move whenever somebody reordered a
 * grid on the services page. A stable order is worth more here: this is the
 * screen a returning visitor half-remembers.
