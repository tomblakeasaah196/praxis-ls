/**
 * Browser-side image compression for public-web.
 *
 * A DELIBERATE COPY of client/src/lib/image-compress.ts, not an import. This
 * app installs only its own dependencies in CI and does not resolve anything
 * from `client/` or `@praxis/shared` (see the import ban in eslint.config.js) —
 * a cross-app import resolves locally via the root workspace and then fails in
 * CI, which is the exact trap that ban exists to stop people falling into.
 *
 * Keep the two in step. The profile table and the quality numbers must match
 * `src/services/image-pipeline.service.js`, which is the authority for both.
 *
 * This app matters MORE than the other two for compression, not less. Its
 * uploads come from strangers on phones — a candidate photographing a CV, a
 * prospect attaching a scanned bill of lading — over the corridor's own
 * connections, with no account and no second attempt if it fails.
