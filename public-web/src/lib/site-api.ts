/**
 * The tenant's own website content — `GET /api/tenant/public/site/pages/:key`.
 *
 * ── WHY THE PROOF STRIP READS FROM HERE AND NOWHERE ELSE ──────────────────
 *
 * A figures band is the one thing on a marketing page that is worth the most
 * when it is true and costs the most when it is not. `WEB_BUILD_BRIEF.md` N12
 * forbids inventing one, and a hardcoded "41,850 CBM managed" in a white-label
 * product is not a placeholder — it is a claim every other tenant would have to
 * find and delete before launch, and the ones they miss end up in front of a
 * procurement officer.
 *
 * So the numbers come from the tenant's own `stat_counters` blocks, and the
 * server has already resolved each one against its metric registry
 * (`site_content.metrics.js`) before it answers: where a block names a metric,
 * `value` is what the ledger says this morning; where it does not, `value` is
 * the literal the tenant typed. The renderer is never handed the choice, which
 * is why there is no `metric_key` in the payload below.
 *
 * A tenant with no home page, no published page, or the `website` package off
 * has no strip. That is the correct empty state and the caller draws nothing —
 * a band that says "statistics coming soon" is worse than no band.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS MODULE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * It is not a page renderer. The block library has fourteen types and the
 * marketing page is a hand-built scaffold, not a CMS view; consuming the two
 * stat types is a narrow, honest read of content the tenant already authors.
 * Anything more is the site-builder project, not this one.

 *
 * THREE CLAIMS, AND THE `kind` COLUMN IS WHAT KEEPS THEM APART. 13782's header
 * carries the argument; the short version is that "we move cargo on these
 * lines", "these organisations trust us" and "we are a member of this" are
 * three different assertions, and one grid makes none of them. N11 forbids the
 * undifferentiated wall.
 *
 * `permission_note` is never in this payload and cannot be: the read builds an
 * explicit object and filters on the note as well as on `is_active`, and 13782
 * makes an active row without one impossible in the first place.
