/**
 * One identity per service card: a glyph, a freight-mode colour, and a code.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS ONE TABLE AND NOT THREE DECISIONS ─────────────────────────
 *
 * The services grid needs a glyph (§7.3), a `--mode-*` colour (P1-1) and a mono
 * service code (P1-2), and all three have to agree — a card whose panel is green
 * and whose tile is blue is not one card, it is two half-designed ones. Keeping
 * them in one row of one table is what makes "recognisable by colour before it
 * is read" true on the home page, the services index and the service page at the
 * same time.
 *
 * ── KEYED ON POSITION, NEVER ON WHAT THE CARD SAYS ────────────────────────
 *
 * This is the rule the glyph cycle already followed, and it matters more now
 * that colour is involved. Matching an identity to a tenant-authored name — "a
 * ship for the sea-freight profile" — means this file guessing at the meaning of
 * strings it did not write, in two languages, and being wrong on the first
 * tenant who writes "Maritime & Air" or "Groupage". Position is a fact; the
 * service's mode is not ours to infer.
 *
 * The mode colours are therefore an IDENTITY PALETTE, not a taxonomy: card three
 * is `--mode-road` because it is third, and no claim is made that it moves by
 * road. That is also how the work order assigns them (customs clearance drawn in
 * `--mode-air`), so the colours read as four distinct lines rather than as a
 * legend a reader is expected to decode.
 *
 * ── WHERE THIS IS GOING, SO THE NEXT READER IS NOT SURPRISED ──────────────
 *
 * Position stays the fallback and stays correct. What changes in PR 4 of
 * doc/PUBLIC_WEB_EXPERIENCE_GUIDE.md is that where a tenant TELLS us a
 * service's freight mode, we use it, and the palette becomes semantic on that
 * card — sea freight actually drawn in `--mode-sea`. The two paths coexist
 * deliberately: a fact the tenant supplied is worth more than a position, and a
 * position is worth more than a guess at what somebody else's words mean.
 *
 * Note also that the mode VALUES are no longer fixed per install: since the
 * palette engine landed they are harmonised toward the tenant's own colours,
 * hue held within ten degrees of its anchor. Sea is still green. See
 * packages/shared/design/palette.js and the guide's §1.4.
 *
 * ── AND THEREFORE ORANGE IS STILL THE ONLY THING THAT LOOKS CLICKABLE ─────
 *
 * Mode colours are used for the card's top bar, its icon tile and its panel —
 * all identity. They are never used for a button, a link or the "See this
 * service" arrow, which stay `--primary-ink`. A grid where four different
 * colours are clickable teaches a visitor nothing about which colour means "you
 * may press this".
