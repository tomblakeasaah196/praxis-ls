/**
 * `/public/careers` and `/public/careers/:token` — the one screen in this product
 * a stranger reads twice before they trust it, because what they are submitting is
 * themselves.
 *
 * ── WHAT THE PORT KEEPS FROM `client/src/features/careers/careers-page.tsx` ──
 *
 * Three behaviours, all of them load-bearing:
 *
 *   1. THE RECEIPT SAYS WHETHER THE CV LANDED. `apply()` returns
 *      `{ received, reference, cv_attached }`, and the server records the
 *      application even when the upload fails ("better a candidate with a
 *      reference than a candidate with nothing"). Rendering only "Thank you"
 *      would tell a person their CV is in a pile when it may not be — so the
 *      confirmation is a different sentence for each case.
 *   2. THE FILE IS SIZE-CHECKED BEFORE IT IS READ. `fileToDataUrl` refuses over
 *      8 MB, matching `CV_MAX_BYTES` in `careers.service`, so an oversized scan
 *      is a message at selection time and not a lost form after a minute on a
 *      metered connection.
 *   3. WHAT THE ROLE INSISTS ON IS SAID FIRST. `apply_config` carries
 *      `require_cover_letter` / `require_portfolio`; the server enforces them and
 *      returns named field errors, so the form marks them required up front
 *      instead of letting somebody write five paragraphs and then be refused.
 *
 * ── WHAT CHANGES HERE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The `salaryBand` phrase comes from the dictionary in both languages (the ERP's
 * version hardcodes "From"/"Up to", so a French advert read "From 1 250 000
 * FCFA"), and the sandbox banner is a sentence in both languages rather than an
 * English-only string. A test advert that only warns the English-reading half of
 * the applicants is a warning that did not happen.
