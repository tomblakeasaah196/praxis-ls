/**
 * The careers page, and specifically the state it is in most of the time (13792).
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS FILE IS ACTUALLY GUARDING ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A company of forty hires a handful of times a year, so an empty vacancy list
 * is this route's NORMAL state, not its edge case. What used to be rendered
 * there was a dashed box reading "No open roles right now / Please check back" —
 * on a white-label product, on the page a stranger forms their impression of the
 * tenant from.
 *
 * The three things below are each a decision that could be reverted by somebody
 * tidying up, and each would look harmless in a diff:
 *
 *   1. THE BUTTONS FOLLOW THE TENANT'S SWITCHES, both of which default OFF.
 *      Showing an application form to a tenant who never asked for one starts a
 *      pipeline nobody is reading; hiding one from a tenant who did makes the
 *      setting a lie.
 *   2. AN UNCONFIGURED TENANT STILL GETS SOMEWHERE TO GO. That is every tenant
 *      on day one, so the contact fallback is the commonest rendering of this
 *      band and not a corner of it.
 *   3. THE TENANT'S OWN BLOCKS RENDER WHETHER OR NOT ROLES ARE OPEN. Building
 *      "why work here" as empty-state decoration would mean the effort only
 *      ever reached the visitors who found nothing.
