/**
 * `/quote` — the quote desk, on its own page.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS NOT A BAND ON THE HOME PAGE ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It was one, and the header's "Request a quote" button pointed at
 * `/public#quote`. That is broken in a single-page app in two different ways,
 * and both of them look like a dead button to a visitor:
 *
 *   · **From another page**, the router navigates to the home page and the
 *     browser tries to scroll to `#quote` before the lazily-loaded marketing
 *     chunk has rendered the element. There is nothing to scroll to yet, so the
 *     visitor lands at the top of the home page having asked for a form.
 *   · **From the home page itself**, the URL's hash changes and React Router
 *     re-renders what is already mounted. No navigation, no scroll, nothing
 *     happens at all.
 *
 * A route fixes both because there is no scroll to time — the page IS the form.
 *
 * It also buys three things a hash cannot:
 *
 *   · a URL somebody can send. "Fill this in" is the single most-pasted link a
 *     sales desk produces, and `…/#quote` drops a recipient at the top of a
 *     marketing page.
 *   · its own title, description and share card. A quote form is a conversion
 *     page and it is worth indexing on its own terms.
 *   · a lighter home page. The wizard, the place picker and the file reader are
 *     a route-level chunk now, so a visitor who came to read about services no
 *     longer downloads a four-step form to scroll past it.
 *
 * The home page keeps `#quote` as a band that points here, so links already in
 * circulation still land somewhere that makes sense.
