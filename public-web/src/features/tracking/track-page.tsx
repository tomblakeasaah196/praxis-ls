/**
 * `/public/track` — the public lookup, and the page most visitors of this whole
 * app are actually here for.
 *
 * ── WHY THE REFERENCE LIVES IN THE URL ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `?ref=…` IS the state, so the page is reproducible, shareable and
 * bookmarkable, and the Back button means something. Freight references get copied
 * out of WhatsApp messages and read aloud over the phone; a lookup whose result
 * cannot be expressed as a URL is a lookup that cannot be handed to the next
 * person. The hero widget on every other page writes the same parameter, so the
 * handoff from the homepage is a navigation rather than a second code path.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS PAGE IS NOT ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It is not a carrier integration. `tracking_public.routes.js` reads the tenant's
 * own milestone ledger and computes a status from it — no project44, no carrier
 * portal, no scraping of a line's tracking site. Which is why the empty answer is
 * "we have no record of that reference" and never "your vessel is delayed": there
 * is no feed behind this page to support a claim like that. The milestone set is
 * exactly what the tenant's operations team marked client-visible, so the copy
 * says whose judgement produced this list rather than implying a global network.
 *
 * ── THE FIVE OUTCOMES, AND WHY NONE OF THEM SHARE A COMPONENT ──────────────
 *
 * idle · loading · found · not-found · rate-limited · failed. `doc/
 * PUBLIC_WEB_PLAN.md` §3.3 requires the middle four to be designed and, in
 * particular, requires not-found to be distinguishable from empty: "no shipment
 * matches that reference" and "this file has no visible stages yet" are
 * different facts with different next actions, and a client whose file was
 * opened this morning must not be told their reference is wrong.
 *
 * The rate limit gets its own outcome for the same reason. The lookup allows 30
 * attempts per 15 minutes per connection, an office behind one NAT address
 * shares that ceiling, and it is reached at 17:00 on a busy day. Folded into a
 * generic failure it would leave the twelfth colleague concluding their shipment
 * has vanished — so it is stated plainly, and it is the one failure that does
 * NOT offer a retry button, because retrying is exactly what it is asking the
 * visitor to stop doing.
 *
 * ── WHAT PR 4 CHANGED (guide §8.1) ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The answer moved above the identity. It used to open with the reference as an
 * `<h2>` and put the status in a pill in the top-right corner — which is the
 * layout of an internal record, and it puts the thing the visitor already knows
 * above the thing they came to find out. `track-result.tsx` now leads with the
 * status at display size and demotes the reference to a definition list beneath
 * it, and the timeline became a spatial object rather than a bulleted list.
 *
 * The other half of §8.1 is these outcome screens. "A wrong reference is the
 * most common outcome on this page and it currently gets the least design": a
 * centred sentence and a link. They are plates now, at the same weight as the
 * answer, and each one states what happened, what it does NOT mean, and the
 * next action that is actually available.
