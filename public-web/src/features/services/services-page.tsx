/**
 * `/public/services` and `/public/services/:slug` — the tenant's published service
 * profiles, off `GET /public/services[/:slug]`.
 *
 * ── WHY NOTHING HERE IS WRITTEN BY US ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every heading, paragraph, highlight and FAQ answer on these two pages is a row
 * the tenant authored in their admin and published to the web. The scaffold owns
 * the LAYOUT and the language handling; it owns no copy. The alternative — seeding a
 * "Sea Freight" page with invented transit times and included services — is the
 * failure `WEB_BUILD_BRIEF.md` N12 names, and it is more dangerous here than
 * anywhere else on the site, because a service page is the page a buyer forwards to
 * whoever signs.
 *
 * ── WHY THE OTHER LANGUAGE LINK IS A MAP LOOKUP ────────────────────────────
 *
 * `GET /public/services/:slug` returns `alternates: {en, fr}` because the profile
 * stores both slugs for one row. A switcher built on that map can promise the
 * equivalent page; a switcher built on "translate the URL" cannot, and the usual
 * fallback — send the unknown one to the homepage — strands a French reader on a
 * page they never asked for. No `alternates`, no switcher.

              uploaded for exactly this screen. The index grid used it; the page
              the index links to did not.

              It is an image in the band, not a background behind the heading. A
              scrim over tenant-uploaded artwork is a contrast problem solved per
              photograph (see `hero.tsx`, where the floor is set by the eyebrow at
              α ≥ 0.87), and there is no floor that holds for every image a
              stranger may upload. Beneath the type it needs no scrim at all. */}
