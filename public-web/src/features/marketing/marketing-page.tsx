/**
 * The marketing home — `/public`.
 *
 * ── SECTION ORDER, WHICH IS NOT DECORATIVE ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Maersk's front page runs: lookup → services → how-we-work → proof → commercial
 * CTA. That is a persuasion sequence borrowed from industrial procurement, not
 * from consumer landing pages: establish that the company can do the thing, that
 * the reader understands what working with them feels like, that someone else has
 * already been carried through it — and only THEN ask for the enquiry. The order
 * matters more than any single band, so the quote form sits sixth of six and the
 * track widget sits first, because the track widget is why half of this page's
 * audience came.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS NOT HERE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * No metric strip, no logo wall, no testimonial, no "since 2009". The backend
 * exposes no public statistics, no client logos and no quotes, and
 * `WEB_BUILD_BRIEF.md` N12 forbids inventing one — a fabricated "98 % on-time" on
 * a scaffold is not a placeholder, it is a lie a tenant has to find and delete
 * before launch, and the ones they miss are the ones that end up in front of a
 * procurement officer. The proof band therefore shows the tenant's published case
 * notes or a sentence saying there are none yet, which is the only honest version
 * of that section this product can currently render.
 *
 * ── ONE `<h1>` PER PAGE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The hero owns it; every band below is a `Section`, whose default heading is
 * `h2` (N10). Adding a second h1 to "make the CTA band shout" is how the heading
 * outline stops meaning anything to a screen reader.

        The wizard lives at its own route now (features/quote/quote-page.tsx
        records why the hash version was broken). Keeping a second copy here
        would mean two places to keep in step and would put the wizard, the
        place picker and the file reader into the home page's payload — which a
        visitor who came to read about services would download to scroll past.

        The `id="quote"` stays: links to `…/#quote` are already in circulation,
        and this is where they should land.
