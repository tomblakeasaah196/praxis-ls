/**
 * The route table for the stranger-facing app.
 *
 * ── TWO PREFIXES, AND WHY THEY ARE THERE ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `/public/*` is the marketing site and everything a visitor reads without an
 * account; `/portal/*` is the external portal a client, investor or auditor signs
 * into. Both prefixes are deliberate, not inherited: this app is served from the
 * SAME origin as the tenant ERP (`src/server.js` mounts it beside `client/dist`),
 * so the prefix is what keeps `/track` — an ERP screen — from being quietly
 * reinterpreted as this app's `/track`. The one exception is the redirect table
 * below, which exists precisely so the old ERP links keep working.
 *
 * ── WHY EVERYTHING BUT THE BOUNDARY IS `React.lazy` ────────────────────────
 *
 * The heaviest screens here are also the least-visited from any given entry
 * point: a tracking visitor never downloads the portal's terminal tables, a
 * portal user never downloads the careers form or the PDF-bearing proposal
 * document. One shared entry chunk would make every one of them pay for all of
 * them — and the audience this app serves is a phone on a metered connection in
 * Douala, which is the reason `package.json` exists separately from `client/` at
 * all. The boundary is loaded eagerly because a page that cannot render without
 * a second request would flash.
 *
 * ── `/` REDIRECTS AND NOTHING ELSE DOES ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Rule inherited from the ERP's own landing behaviour: the bare root may redirect
 * (there is no other sensible thing to put there), a deep link never does. A
 * forwarded `/public/proposals/xyz?lang=FR` must land on exactly that page in
 * that language, or the shared link the sales team sent is wrong.
 *
 * ── AND ON A HOST THE SITE OWNS, `/` DOES NOT REDIRECT EITHER ──────────────
 *
 * `IS_ROOT` is true on a domain the client brought, where this app is the only
 * thing served and `p()` is `/`. Two things then have to change, and both are
 * about the same trap — a redirect whose source and target have become the same
 * string:
 *
 *   · `/` would redirect to `/`, which is a loop the browser reports as
 *     "too many redirects" and no stack trace explains.
 *   · the legacy block below would do it again per path: `/track` redirecting to
 *     `p("/track")`, which at the root IS `/track`.
 *
 * So both are skipped at the root, where those paths are not legacy aliases —
 * they are the canonical URLs. `/tracking`, `/proposal/:token` (singular) and
 * `/client-portal/*` still redirect there, because those spellings are wrong on
 * every host.
