/**
 * Fade-and-rise a block the first time it scrolls into view
 * (doc/UI_UPGRADE_PLAN.md §6.6) — their `data-reveal`, which is on nearly every
 * element of their site and is a large part of why it feels considered.
 *
 * ── ONE OBSERVER, NOT ONE PER ELEMENT ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A page can carry thirty of these. Thirty IntersectionObservers is thirty
 * callbacks the browser schedules on every scroll frame; one observer with
 * thirty targets is one. The shared instance is created lazily so a page with
 * no Reveal on it pays nothing, and each element unobserves itself the moment
 * it fires.
 *
 * ── IT NEVER RE-ANIMATES ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Unobserve-on-fire is the whole mechanism: an element that fades every time it
 * is scrolled past is a page that reads as broken, and it is the single most
 * common way this effect is got wrong.
 *
 * ── REDUCED MOTION IS NOT A SHORTER ANIMATION ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` renders the settled state immediately — no
 * transform, no transition, no observer at all. Somebody who has asked their
 * system for less motion has not asked for faster motion. `Skeleton` sets the
 * same precedent with `motion-reduce:animate-none`.
 *
 * ── WHY IT MAY START HIDDEN ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The plan's first draft required the settled state on first paint so a reader
 * with JavaScript disabled would still see the content. That requirement was
 * wrong for THIS app and has been corrected in the plan: `public-web` is
 * client-rendered — `public-head.js` says so in as many words, "the body is
 * still empty, so this is not SSR and does not pretend to be" — so with
 * JavaScript off nothing renders at all and there is no content for a hidden
 * class to hide. What a crawler reads is the `<head>`, which is built on the
 * server and is untouched by any of this.
