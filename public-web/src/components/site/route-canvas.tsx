/**
 * The hero's route network, alive.
 *
 * ── WHAT REPLACED WHAT ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `RouteGraphic` (graphics.tsx) is a static SVG with three dashed lanes and a
 * CSS marching-ants stroke. It is a good drawing and it stays — the proof band
 * and the empty states still use it. What it cannot do is carry cargo: the
 * dashes march, but nothing travels, so the diagram says "these are routes"
 * rather than "these are routes in use".
 *
 * Guide §7.1 asks for the second thing, on the LCP element, for ≤ 6 kB.
 *
 * ── WHY A CANVAS AND NOT MORE SVG ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Twenty moving cargo marks in SVG is twenty DOM nodes whose `cx`/`cy` are
 * written every frame — twenty style recalculations and a layout the browser
 * cannot skip, on the element that decides this page's LCP. One `<canvas>` is
 * one composited surface and one draw call per frame. The whole scene below is
 * about a hundred lines of arithmetic; the SVG version would be about the same
 * amount of code and would cost the main thread far more.
 *
 * ── HAND-WRITTEN, AND THAT IS THE BUDGET DECISION ─────────────────────────
 *
 * No library. The smallest general-purpose canvas/animation package worth
 * having is larger than this entire file, and none of them would be on the LCP
 * path anyway — §7.1 forbids anything here waiting on a lazy import, so a
 * dependency would have to be bundled into first paint. The 128 kB budget is
 * spent on the app, not on a tweening engine used by one component.
 *
 * ── IT STOPS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Two ways, both of them non-negotiable:
 *
 *   · OFF SCREEN. `useInView` (a shared observer — see reveal.tsx) cancels the
 *     frame loop the moment the hero scrolls away. A marketing page that keeps
 *     a rAF loop running for a canvas nobody can see is a page that drains a
 *     phone while the reader is four bands further down.
 *   · REDUCED MOTION. One frame, drawn once, showing the network AT REST with
 *     its cargo distributed along the lanes. Not a slower animation, not a
 *     shorter one — the settled state, which is what §1.2 rule 1 means and what
 *     `check:motion` asserts the umbrella still enforces for CSS.
 *
 * ── COLOUR COMES FROM TOKENS, READ AT RUN TIME ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * A canvas cannot reference a CSS custom property, so the values are read once
 * from the computed style and re-read when the theme attribute changes. That
 * keeps the one rule white-labelling depends on: the lanes are `--mode-sea`,
 * `--mode-air`, `--mode-road` and `--mode-rail`, harmonised per §5.2 to the
 * tenant's own palette, and nothing here contains a colour literal.

 * outlines, no counts. §7.5 states the rule for the corridor set piece and it
 * applies here first: a diagram that implies lanes the tenant does not run is a
 * claim, and N12 forbids the site making one. This says "a network exists",
 * which is true of every freight company that has a website.
