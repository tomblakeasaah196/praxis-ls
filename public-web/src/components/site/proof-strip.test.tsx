/**
 * The band that is allowed not to exist.
 *
 * A figures strip is the one thing on a marketing page worth the most when it
 * is true and costing the most when it is not, so the properties asserted here
 * are the ones that keep it honest in a white-label product:
 *
 *   1. NOTHING IS INVENTED. Every visible word and number comes from the
 *      tenant's own blocks. There is no default set of figures, and a tenant
 *      who has authored none gets no band — not a row of dashes, not "coming
 *      soon", which is the same harm in the honest direction.
 *   2. THE SERVER'S NUMBER WINS. `site_content.service.js` has already replaced
 *      a bound stat's literal with the live value before it answers, and the
 *      renderer shows what it was handed rather than re-deciding.
