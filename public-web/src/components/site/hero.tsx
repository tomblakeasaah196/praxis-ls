/**
 * The hero — a dark plate, one promise, two ways out.
 *
 * ── WHAT THE LAYOUT IS DOING (the maersk.com borrow, specifically) ─────────
 *
 * The category's front doors — Maersk, CMA CGM, MSC, DHL — put the same three
 * things in the first screenful in the same order: a headline that names the
 * service rather than the brand's feelings, the functional box most visitors came
 * for, and one commercial CTA. The reason is audience arithmetic: on a freight
 * site far more people are checking something that already exists than shopping
 * for something new, and a hero optimised for the smaller group fails the
 * majority. So the lookup sits ON the hero — the only input above the fold — and
 * the CTA is "Request a quote", not "Sign in": a visitor who already has
 * credentials was sent a direct link and is not deciding here.
 *
 * ── WHY THE ART IS A DRAWING UNLESS THE TENANT SUPPLIES A PHOTO ─────────────
 *
 * No stock imagery (N12: nothing invented, including a stranger's face). If the
 * tenant has uploaded a login background on Settings → Login, that artwork is
 * theirs and gets used — under a scrim, because `BRAND_GUIDELINES.md` forbids
 * placing the identity on a photograph without a solid plate, and because white
 * type over an unknown JPEG is a contrast gamble that only looks fine in the
 * design file.
 *
 * ── WHAT PR 3 ADDED, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DID NOT TOUCH ───────────────
 *
 * Guide §7.1 asks for depth, a stated light source, and a route network that is
 * alive rather than drawn. It also states, in the same breath, that this is the
 * LCP ELEMENT: nothing on this path may wait for a lazy import, so everything
 * below is statically imported and the canvas is hand-written rather than
 * pulled from a package.
 *
 * WHAT DID NOT CHANGE, ON PURPOSE: the two-layer scrim and its measured
 * opacities, and the track widget's place in the layout. The scrim's numbers
 * are re-stated below with their derivation because §7.1 requires any new
 * treatment to re-derive them or keep them — this keeps them, and the pointer
 * light is applied UNDER the scrim so it cannot spend them (see `.hero-light`
 * in index.css for why that is a guarantee rather than a hope). The track
 * widget's real estate is not up for redesign either; it gains material and
 * depth, not demotion.
 *
 * ── WHY `--brand-orange` FOR THE EYEBROW AND NOT `--primary-ink` ───────────
 *
 * The `.eyebrow` recipe sets `--primary-ink`, which is the AA-corrected orange
 * for TYPE ON WHITE (#C74600, 4.88:1). On carbon it measures about 3.4:1 and
 * fails, while the brand colour itself (#FF5A00) measures 6.33:1. That asymmetry
 * is documented in `@praxis/brand` as a property of the colour, not an
 * oversight — so a dark band uses the fill value as text, which is what the ink
 * step-down exists to make unnecessary on light grounds.

 * THE SCRIM FLOORS, AS NUMBERS A TEST CAN READ.
 *
 * These were a comment. Guide §7.1 requires any new treatment of this band to
 * "re-derive them or keep them", and a comment cannot enforce that — the next
 * person to make the photograph more visible will nudge a percentage in a
 * gradient string and no gate will notice, because nothing in the tree knows
 * these numbers mean anything.
 *
 * So they are constants, `hero.test.tsx` asserts every stop where copy sits is
 * at or above the binding floor, and changing one now means changing a test
 * that says what it protects.
 *
 * The derivation, unchanged. Measured against the worst case a tenant can
 * upload — a blown-out, near-white photograph — the minimum scrim opacity for
 * each piece of hero copy is:
 *

 * is what breaks first, exactly as it is for the scrim. On carbon:
 *
 *     a = 0.18   ground L = 0.0196   eyebrow 4.96:1
 *     a = 0.22   ground L = 0.0237   eyebrow 4.56:1   ← the ceiling
 *     a = 0.26   ground L = 0.0281   eyebrow 4.30:1   ✗
 *
 * The value that actually paints is `--beam-peak` in index.css, because that is
 * where the gradient is; this is the ceiling it is held to, and `hero.test.tsx`

            THE LIGHT, WHICH THIS BAND HAS BEEN DESCRIBING AND NOT RENDERING.

            `.hero-light` has been in index.css since PR 3, with a note in this
            file saying "the pointer light is applied UNDER the scrim so it
            cannot spend them". It was never mounted. The comment was true about
            the design and false about the page, which is the worst combination
            — every later reader trusted it.

            It is inside the `image` branch, and that is the whole safety
            argument rather than an accident of where it was typed. The
            derivation the scrim floors rest on is "lightening cannot take an
            image past white, so the copy's contrast is bounded below by the
            near-white case that was measured". That argument needs a scrim
            above the light, and the scrims only exist when there is a
            photograph. On a band with no upload there is no scrim, so the same
            glow would lighten the carbon directly under the copy — where the
            eyebrow, at 4.5:1, is the thing that breaks first.

          One raked beam crosses the band every `--beam-cycle`, passing BEHIND
          the headline word by word and handing off to the plate's edge as it
          leaves — one event, two consumers, one token.

          Paint order is the whole safety argument, and it is why this sits in
          its own block between two conditionals rather than tidily inside one
          of them. With a tenant photograph the scrims below render AFTER it and
          therefore above it, so the wash that caps the image caps the beam and
          the measured floors bind unchanged. Without one there is no scrim, and
          the beam is on bare carbon under the copy at `--beam-peak` — 22 %,
          derived against the eyebrow in the token block. Either way no type on
          this band changes colour as the beam passes; only the ground behind it
          does.

          The long note on `.hero-beam-track` in index.css carries the rest: why
          a loop is allowed here at all, why it stops when the band is off
          screen, why each layer's BASE style is already its settled state so
          the reduced-motion umbrella leaves the band correct, and what the
          first draft of this did to the eyebrow when the beam was on top
          instead. */}

            difference, and the hero read as a SaaS band rather than a freight
            company's door.

            The binding constraint is the EYEBROW, not the headline — which is
            the opposite of what it looks like. The measurement and the floor it
            produces are `SCRIM_FLOOR` at the top of this file, where a test can

            `.tilt-plate` adds §7.1's depth rung 2 on top of it: a real rotation
            in the stage's perspective, three degrees at the most, which goes
            flat the moment anybody focuses a field inside. The widget keeps its
            real estate and gains material — that audience arithmetic is not up
            for redesign, and this is not a demotion of it. */}

            `.tilt-plate` owns `transform` on the plate and rewrites it every
            frame from the pointer. An entrance animating the same property
            would either be wiped by the first mouse movement or wipe the tilt,
            depending on which won the cascade — and it would look correct in
            review either way, because a still screenshot cannot show a conflict
            that only appears once the pointer moves. Two transforms, two
            elements, `preserve-3d` on the wrapper so it does not flatten the
            rotation it contains. */}

                  muted ink, which measures 3.37:1 on this ground and fails.
