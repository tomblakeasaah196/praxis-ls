/**
 * The announcements band — directly under the hero (Q17: "around the hero
 * section", "more than important").
 *
 * ── IT IS ABSENT WHEN EMPTY, AND THAT IS THE FEATURE ──────────────────────
 *
 * No "no announcements yet" state, no skeleton that resolves to nothing, no
 * placeholder. §7.2 is explicit and it is the same rule N12 applies everywhere
 * on this site: a band that announces it has nothing to announce is worse than
 * no band. Most tenants will never pin anything, and their homepage should look
 * like a homepage that was designed without this band rather than one with a
 * hole in it.
 *
 * So: `null` until the read lands, `null` if the read fails, `null` if nothing
 * is pinned. The only thing that renders it is a live pin.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS NOT A MARQUEE, THOUGH IT MOVES ────────────────────────────
 *
 * A marquee is the obvious shape and every part of it is wrong here:
 *
 *   · It duplicates its content to fake a seamless loop, which puts every link
 *     in the tab order TWICE and reads every headline to a screen reader twice.
 *   · It cannot be stopped, so a reader who is slower than the animation never
 *     finishes a sentence.
 *   · It has no relationship to focus, so tabbing into it fights it.
 *
 * What this does instead is drive the container's own `scrollLeft`. The DOM
 * holds each announcement EXACTLY ONCE, so the tab order is the list and the
 * accessibility tree is the list. The browser's native scrolling does the rest:
 * tabbing to a link off the right-hand edge scrolls it into view for free, and
 * a trackpad swipe or a two-finger drag works because it is a real scroller,
 * not a transform.
 *
 * It stops for everything that means somebody is reading it: hover, focus
 * anywhere inside, a hidden tab, the band leaving the viewport, and any scroll
 * the visitor performs themselves (which then holds it for a few seconds — a
 * band that fights the hand pushing it is worse than one that does not move).
 *
 * ── aria-live="off", DELIBERATELY ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * §7.2 names it. This is ambient, not urgent: the content does not change while
 * the page is open, and a polite live region on a band that scrolls would have
 * a screen reader announcing headlines the reader did not ask for. The pins are
 * a list, and a list is what is exposed.
 */
