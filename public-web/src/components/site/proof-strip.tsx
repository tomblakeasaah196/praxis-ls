/**
 * The proof strip — figures and credentials, directly under the hero.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS BAND EXISTS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A visitor who scrolls one screen should have seen a number, a certification
 * and a network name. Without them the page is a well-mannered brochure that
 * asks to be trusted and offers nothing to trust — and a reader who has not
 * seen proof by the time they reach the services grid reads the whole page as
 * a new company.
 *
 * ── WHY EVERY WORD IN IT BELONGS TO THE TENANT ────────────────────────────
 *
 * `WEB_BUILD_BRIEF.md` N12, and it binds hardest here. A figure is the one
 * thing on a marketing page worth the most when true and costing the most when
 * not, and this is a white-label product: a "41,850 CBM managed" typed into
 * this file would be a claim on every tenant's public website that nobody at
 * that tenant ever made. So the strip renders `stat_counters` and `stat_chips`
 * blocks the tenant authored on their own home page, and the server has already
 * replaced each figure with the live value where the block named a metric
 * (`site_content.metrics.js`) — which is the thing no web agency can sell them:
 * numbers that are true this morning rather than true on the day somebody typed
 * them.
 *
 * ── AND WHY IT DRAWS NOTHING RATHER THAN A PLACEHOLDER ────────────────────
 *
 * No page, no published page, no `website` package, no stat blocks: the band is
 * simply not there. The alternative — a row of dashes, or "statistics coming
 * soon" — is the same category of harm as an invented number, in the honest
 * direction: it advertises that the site is unfinished on the screen that
 * decides whether a reader keeps scrolling.
 *
 * It also means the band POPS IN on a slow connection rather than reserving
 * space, and that is the deliberate side of the trade. A skeleton here would
 * hold a hole open on every tenant who has no strip, which is most of them
 * until they write one; a band that appears when it has something to say holds
 * nothing open for anybody.
 *
 * ── CARBON, AND WHY THAT IS NOT A SECOND DARK BAND ────────────────────────
 *
 * It butts straight under the hero on the same `--hero` ground, separated by a
 * hairline rather than by a gap, so hero and strip read as one plate. The one
 * dark LANDMARK further down the page is the portal band; this is the bottom
 * edge of the first one.
