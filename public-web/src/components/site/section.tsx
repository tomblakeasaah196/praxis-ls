/** A card in a service/insight grid: optional media, an eyebrow, a title, copy,

 *
 *  ── WHY A CARD WITHOUT A COVER GETS A DRAWN PANEL ─────────────────────────
 *
 *  `icon` is the `__card-top` half of their grammar (UI_UPGRADE_PLAN §4 pattern
 *  4, §7.3). It is drawn ONLY when there is no cover, and it is not decoration
 *  for its own sake: a tenant who has published four services and uploaded one
 *  photograph gets one illustrated card beside three text boxes, which reads as
 *  three broken cards. A drawn plate is the honest placeholder — it says "a
 *  service", which is true, rather than standing in for a photograph nobody took
 *  (N12).
 *
 *  There are two of them. A card that knows its `mode` composes a panel: a wash
 *  of its own colour, its glyph bled off the corner, its code in the mono face.
 *  A card that does not — an insight, a case note — keeps the centred tile it
 *  always had, which is why the insights grid is untouched by any of this. */
