 * The two graphics this app draws by hand, in the brand's node-network language:
 * **orange nodes, orange 1px connectors, slate structure**
 * (`doc/BRAND_GUIDELINES.md` §2 — "every diagram on the site … is drawn in it").
 *
 * WHY SVG AND NOT PHOTOGRAPHY. Three reasons, and the first is a rule rather than
 * a taste: `doc/WEB_BUILD_BRIEF.md` N12 forbids stock photos of people and any
 * fact not present in the source documents, and this app has no image library and
 * no rights to one. The second is the tenant: an unbranded tenant has no photos,
 * and a hero that ships a stranger's face until they upload theirs is a bug that
 * appears on the day it matters. The third is the meter — these are a few hundred
 * bytes of path data where a hero JPEG is 200 kB, against a 600 kB page budget.
 *
 * Both are `aria-hidden`, and both carry no invented facts: no port names, no
 * vessel names, no percentages that purport to be somebody's shipment. The copy
 * beside them is what says something.
 *
 * Every colour is a token, so a tenant re-brand repaints the diagram along with
 * the page.
