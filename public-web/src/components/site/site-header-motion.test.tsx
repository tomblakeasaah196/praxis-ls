/**
 * The header as an object — the four properties that make it one, and that
 * would each revert in silence.
 *
 * None of this is "does it look good". Every assertion below is a decision that
 * cost something to reach and that nothing else in the tree protects:
 *
 *   · The condense is DIRECTION-AWARE. A future refactor to a plain positional
 *     scrub is a two-line simplification that looks tidier and quietly makes
 *     the language switcher and the portal link unreachable for the whole
 *     length of every long page. That is the regression this file exists for.
 *   · Reduced motion pins the composition rather than speeding it up — the one
 *     rule in this app with no exception (guide §1.2) — while the progress rail
 *     keeps tracking, because it is information and not decoration. Both halves
 *     matter and they pull in opposite directions, which is exactly how one of
 *     them gets lost.
 *   · The nav has ONE highlight. The moment somebody adds a `:hover`
 *     background back onto `.navlink` there are two, and the travel stops being
 *     visible against the thing it travels over.
 *   · The services panel is ABSENT, chevron and all, for a tenant with nothing
 *     published. Same rule as the announcements band. A disclosure that opens
 *     onto an empty grid on somebody's own homepage is the white-label failure
 *     N12 is about.
 *
 * ── WHAT JSDOM CANNOT SAY ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `getBoundingClientRect` answers zeroes here, so the pill's MEASUREMENTS are
 * not assertable and are not asserted. What is assertable is the mechanism:
 * which element exists, whether it is switched on, and when it is told to move.
 * A test that faked the rects would be asserting the fake.
