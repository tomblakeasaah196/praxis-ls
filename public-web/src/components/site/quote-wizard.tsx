/**
 * The quote desk, as four questions instead of one wall of fields.
 *
 * ── WHY A WIZARD AT ALL ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The single-screen version of this form asks a stranger for eleven things
 * before it asks for anything they came to give. Their site got this right and
 * it is the one structural idea worth taking wholesale: Need → Route → Details
 * → Contact, so the first screen is one question and the commitment grows only
 * after they have already invested two answers.
 *
 * What is NOT taken from theirs:
 *
 *   · **the mandatory attachment.** Resolved decision 5. Requiring a commercial
 *     invoice before somebody can ask a price loses every prospect who is still
 *     shopping — which is most of them, and exactly the ones a marketing site
 *     exists to catch.
 *   · **`onsubmit="return false;"` with the real submit on a button's onclick.**
 *     That is how every `required` attribute on their page became decorative:
 *     native validation never runs. Each step here validates before it will
 *     advance, and the same rules gate the final submit.
 *   · **the third-party geocoder.** Theirs sends every keystroke of a route to
 *     an unkeyed public Photon instance and then never submits the coordinates
 *     it captured. Ours go through our own endpoint and are actually stored.
 *   · **`alert()`.** Errors are inline and designed, per §3.3.
 *
 * ── THE BRANCH ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A warehousing enquiry has no route and no Incoterm; a freight enquiry has
 * both, and what "origin" is called depends on the mode — Airport of departure,
 * Port of loading, Place of collection. Their site branches on this and it is
 * right: asking a warehousing prospect for an Incoterm is asking a question
 * with no answer, and a form that does that reads as a form nobody thought
 * about.
 *
 * The incoterm stays REQUIRED on the freight branch (resolved decision 3 — it
 * is the one field the intake schema insists on) and is sent as `N/A` on the
 * warehousing branch, which is a real answer rather than a blank.

              announces "2 of 4" rather than four unrelated pressed/unpressed
