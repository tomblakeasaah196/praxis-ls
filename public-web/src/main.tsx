// seven unicode ranges per family, five of which (cyrillic, cyrillic-ext,
// greek, greek-ext, vietnamese) this product has no audience for, and N5 asks
// for `latin` + `latin-ext`. See the header of fonts.css.

 * synchronously inside, so a returning visitor never sees our heading flip to
 * theirs; the refresh behind it lands a beat later on a first visit, which is
 * the trade `lib/site-copy.ts` argues for at length — holding first paint here
 * would blank the whole site for every tenant who has overridden nothing.
 *
 * No `.catch`: `initSiteCopy` resolves to void on every failure path it has, by
 * construction — a tenant with no overrides and a dead network are the same
 * answer, and that answer is the site as it shipped.

/**
 * One `useLang()` at the root, and that is the whole translation subscription.
 *
 * Most copy here goes through `useTranslation()`, which subscribes by itself. The
 * exceptions are the portals' `tr()` calls — a status token sentence-cased and
 * looked up through the global i18next instance, with no hook to hang a
 * subscription on — which is exactly how a page ends up half in French: the
 * headings re-render, the pills do not. A re-render at the root covers every
 * component that uses the hook-free helper, so the alternative (threading
 * `useTranslation` through ~40 ported components) is not worth the diff.
