/**
 * Post-build gate: the emitted chunk graph is acyclic, and the first-paint
 * payload is inside budget.
 *
 * ── WHY BOTH CHECKS LIVE IN ONE FILE ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * They are the two halves of the same decision. `vite.config.ts` keeps ONE
 * `manualChunks` bucket and splits everything else by route, because this app's
 * reason to exist as a third codebase is what a stranger downloads: a visitor who
 * came to check one shipment reference should not pay for the portal's three
 * terminal screens, and a portal user should not pay for the careers form.
 *
 * That design has three ways to fail, and none of them breaks the build:
 *
 *   1. A CYCLE. On 2026-08-04 the ERP shipped a circular chunk graph; one chunk
 *      read another's export before the binding was assigned, a top-level
 *      `createContext` threw during module evaluation — before React rendered —
 *      and production served a blank `<div id="root">`. Rollup WARNED and exited
 *      0. The fix that must not be attempted is a second manual bucket: two
 *      buckets import each other by construction. So the cycle check and the
 *      chunking strategy are asserted in the same gate, on the same file, so a
 *      change to one is reviewed next to the other.
 *   2. BUDGET DRIFT. A route that quietly stops being lazy (a static import of
 *      `portal-app` from the header, say) adds tens of kB to every first paint
 *      and looks identical in review. The number is the only thing that moves.
 *   3. AN UNBOUNDED DEFERRED PAYLOAD. The opposite mistake, and the one a
 *      capability-gated set piece invites: move the weight behind a dynamic
 *      import and the first-paint number stays green while the page grows a
 *      300 kB scene. Deferred is not free — a visitor who scrolls to the band
 *      downloads it. See DEFERRED_BUDGET_KB.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS MEASURED ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The gzipped bytes of the files `dist/index.html` actually loads up-front: the
 * entry chunk, whatever it statically imports (which is how a lazy route ends up
 * in the payload by accident, and why the HTML's own link tags are the source of
 * truth rather than a filename pattern), and the stylesheet. Font files are
 * reported and NOT counted — they are subset per unicode-range and fetched
 * lazily, and folding them in would let a font swap hide a JS regression.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/check-bundle.mjs   (after `npm run build`)

/**
 * The budget, in gzipped kB, for the entry payload (JS + CSS).
 *
 * Measured at the time of writing: 40.6 (index) + 60.8 (vendor) + 11.9 (css)
 * = 113.3 kB. The cap was 128 kB — about 15 % of headroom, which is deliberately
 * small: it absorbs a dependency patch release or one new shared component, and
 * it cannot absorb a router, a query library or an icon pack. That is the point;
 * a budget with room to spare is a budget nobody will ever consult.
 *
 * ── RAISED ONCE, 128 → 131, AND WHAT THE STRANGER GETS FOR IT ─────────────
 *
 * The site header was rebuilt as a scroll- and pointer-reactive object: the
 * utility strip erodes through a dot mask instead of sliding, the bar deepens
 * its blur and casts a shadow as it condenses, one piece of ink travels between
 * nav items instead of seven backgrounds cross-fading, and the bottom hairline
 * became the page's reading position. It cost **2.4 kB gzip** — 1.2 kB of CSS
 * and 1.2 kB of JS — against 1.5 kB of headroom.
 *
 * This is the raise the header of this file warns about, so here is the working
 * rather than a number that quietly moved:
 *
 *   · IT IS NOT DRIFT. Failure mode 2 above is a route that stopped being lazy.
 *     The chunk graph is unchanged and every route is still split; this is new
 *     code, deliberately written, on a surface every single page renders.
 *   · WHAT WAS TRIED FIRST. The services panel — the largest new piece — is
 *     `React.lazy`, which returned 0.7 kB. Its stylesheet was measured
 *     separately at 335 bytes gzip and left in `index.css` on purpose: moving
 *     it to its own file would take it out of `check:contrast`, `check:motion`
 *     and `check:palette`, all three of which read that one file, and 335 bytes
 *     is not worth a hole in three gates. Its bespoke button, link and eyebrow
 *     rules were deleted in favour of `.btn-primary`, `.more-link` and
 *     `.micro`, which is a saving worth having for its own sake (guide §3.5)
 *     and returned very little here.
 *   · WHAT IS LEFT IS THE FEATURE. Cutting to fit would mean deleting about
 *     half of it. That is a product decision and not a budget one.
 *
 * 131 rather than 130: it restores roughly the 1.5 kB of headroom that existed
 * before, so the next person to add a shared component is refused by their own
 * change rather than by this one. Note the ratio this is defending is still
 * ~87 % vendor-and-framework — the next real win on this number is a dependency,
 * not another 300 bytes of stylesheet.

 * The DEFERRED budget — §5.6, and the thing that keeps a WebGL set piece honest

 * ── WHY THIS DID NOT EXIST UNTIL PR 3 ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * §5.6 specified it as PR 1 work and PR 1 did not ship it (see the guide's
 * §3.4, F-14). The omission mattered the moment §7.5 arrived: the whole
 * argument for a deferred, capability-gated scene is that it costs a visitor
 * who never sees it nothing, and "deferred" without a number is how a marketing
 * page acquires 300 kB of three.js that only ever loads on somebody else's
 * laptop.
 *
 * WHAT IS COUNTED: every emitted chunk that is NOT in the first-paint set.
 * That is deliberately the whole of the rest rather than a hand-maintained list
 * of "homepage" chunks — a list is a thing that goes stale silently, and the
 * budget is far enough above today's total that counting the portal and the
 * careers form too costs nothing and closes the loophole where a chunk is
 * excused by not being named.
