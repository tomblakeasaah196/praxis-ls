/**
 * Motion budget gate for `public-web`.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS APP HAS ITS OWN, AND A DIFFERENT NUMBER ───────────────────────
 *
 * `client/scripts/check-motion.mjs` holds the ERP to 250ms, and its reasoning
 * is right for the ERP: a dispatcher opens the shipments table forty times a
 * day, and a 500ms entrance was costing them twenty seconds a day for a
 * decoration. That gate also carves out an exception, in its own words:
 *
 *   "The front door. `.landing-*` and `.login-*` are the marketing surface and
 *    the sign-in card: seen once per session, before any work starts, and the
 *    only place in this product where 'impression' is the job."
 *
 * This whole app IS that surface. So the exception becomes the rule here — and
 * it is written down and gated rather than left to whoever edits the stylesheet
 * next, because "the marketing site may be expressive" degrades into "nobody
 * checks the marketing site" within about two pull requests.
 *
 * ── TWO BUDGETS, BECAUSE THEY ARE TWO JOBS ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   RESPONSE (200ms) — what happens when a person ACTS. A hover, a press, a
 *   focus ring, a toggle. This must feel like the interface reacting. It is
 *   TIGHTER than the ERP's 250ms, deliberately: on a marketing page the reader
 *   is scanning, and a hover that takes a quarter of a second to acknowledge
 *   them reads as a slow site no matter how beautiful the rest is.
 *
 *   NARRATIVE (600ms) — what happens when a person ARRIVES. A band revealing,
 *   a headline staging in, a diagram assembling. This is the budget the express
 *   exception buys, and it exists on no other surface in this product.
 *
 * A selector is RESPONSE unless it is named in NARRATIVE. That default is the
 * important half: a new transition someone adds without thinking is held to the
 * strict number, and relaxing it is an edit a reviewer can see.
 *
 * ── AND THE REDUCED-MOTION UMBRELLA, WHICH IS THE REAL ASSERTION ───────────
 *
 * A budget is not a substitute for honouring the platform preference. The
 * global kill in index.css is one `!important` away from silently not applying,
 * and nothing in a test suite would notice. This checks it is still there,
 * still covers BOTH animation and transition, and still reaches
 * pseudo-elements.

 * ── EVERY STYLESHEET, NOT JUST index.css — O-13 ────────────────────────────
 *
 * This gate read one file. `index.css` is where the motion is TODAY, which is
 * why nobody noticed, and it is not where the motion is DEFINED: `main.tsx`
 * imports three stylesheets, and any component may add a fourth. A
 * `transition: opacity 3000ms` in `fonts.css` passed this gate silently —
 * verified by putting one there, which is the only way to establish a gate's
 * blind spot rather than assume its absence.
 *
 * The rule is every `.css` under `src/`, discovered rather than listed. A list
 * is a thing that goes stale in exactly the way that produced this finding, and
 * a stylesheet in the app's own tree is either shipped or dead — scanning a dead
 * one costs a millisecond and misses nothing.
 *
 * `index.css` keeps its own binding above: the reduced-motion umbrella and the
 * `@layer` structure are properties OF that file, so §3 asserts against it by
 * name. Only the timing budget is graph-wide, because a slow transition is slow
 * wherever it is declared.
