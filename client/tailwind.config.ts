/**
 * Praxis LS design tokens.
 *
 * Semantic colours resolve to the CSS variables in src/index.css so the tenant
 * white-label loader (src/lib/theme.ts) can override --primary etc. at runtime
 * without a rebuild.
 *
 * PHASE 1 (audit F2 / F3 / F14 / F17): before this pass the config extended
 * `colors`, `borderRadius`, `keyframes` and `animation` and nothing else —
 * which is why the app fragmented into 19 ad-hoc type sizes, five unruled page
 * widths and zero desktop breakpoints. The scales below are the missing
 * contract:
 *
 *   screens   `xl` / `2xl` are the DESKTOP tiers this product actually targets.
 *             Every layout decision used to be made at `sm` (640px), so 1280px
 *             and 2560px rendered identically.
 *   fontSize  one ramp. `text-[13px]` and friends become a lint smell.
 *   maxWidth  named page containers, replacing 86 `max-w-6xl` literals.
 *             Consumed through <PageContainer>, not by hand.
 *   spacing   the row steps the table-density work needs.
 *
 * Scope note: `sm` / `md` / `lg` / `xl` keep Tailwind's default pixel values on
 * purpose — this pass adds the missing desktop tier, it does not move the
 * breakpoints existing screens are already written against.

         *
         * These existed in index.css from Phase 1 but were never exposed to
         * Tailwind, so the only way to reach them was the arbitrary-value form:
         *
         *   text-[rgb(var(--ok))]        vs   text-ok
         *   bg-[rgb(var(--ok)_/_0.12)]   vs   bg-ok/10
         *
         * That is the whole reason `text-emerald-600` kept reappearing. The
         * audit called it a discipline problem (F14, rule #1 "never hardcode
         * colours") — it was partly an ergonomics problem: the wrong thing was
         * shorter to type than the right one, and 46 sites took the shortcut.
         *
         * `<alpha-value>` is what lets the slash-opacity syntax work on a
         * variable-backed colour, so `border-ok/40` resolves rather than being
         * silently dropped. That requires the CSS var to hold a bare `R G B`
         * triplet, which is how index.css already defines these.
         *
         * TEXT vs FILL is a real distinction here, not tidiness: `--ok` is the
         * AA-corrected value for type, `--ok-fill` the more saturated one for
         * grounds. Pairing text-ok with bg-ok-fill/12 is what `.st-ok` does, and

       * PHASE 5 — `wide` was 104rem (1664px) and is now 135rem (2160px).
       *
       * This is the item the audit opens with and that three phases deferred.
       * F2's first sentence is that the app "renders identically at 1280px,
       * 1920px and 2560px"; Phase 1 fixed 1280 and 1440 and left 1664 as the
       * ceiling, "so a 1920px display is actually used". It is — 1920 minus the
       * shell's padding is 1856, so 1664 nearly fills it. 2560 does not: it
       * rendered the same column as 1920 with ~450px of margin on each side, and
       * Addenda 6 and 7 both called that "addressed rather than solved" and
       * pointed here, at the density work, because it is one number and it is
       * the same conversation as row height.
       *
       * WHY 2160 AND NOT NO CAP. A table row is read left to right, and the
       * distance from the record's name to its last column is the cost of every
       * lookup. Uncapped, a 2560px display puts 2.5 metres of pixels between
       * "SBX-OPS-2026-0142" and its status. 2160 gives a 2560px display ~30%
       * more content than it had while keeping the row scannable — and the
       * frozen first column (Phase 5) covers the tables that genuinely need to
       * be wider than that.
       *
       * `standard` and `reading` are unchanged on purpose. A settings form does
       * not want more width at any viewport; that was never the complaint.
