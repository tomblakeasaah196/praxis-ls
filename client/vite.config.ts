  /**
   * CHUNKING. A chunk graph must be a DAG, and a hand-drawn partition can cut a
   * cycle into one. That is not hypothetical here — it shipped, and it served
   * smartls.praxisls.com a blank page.
   *
   * The previous config split `vendor-react` (react, react-dom, react-router)
   * out of `vendor` (everything else). But react-dom needs `scheduler` and
   * react-router-dom needs `@remix-run/router`, and neither name matched the
   * react rule, so both landed in `vendor`:
   *
   *     vendor  ──── needs react ────▶  vendor-react
   *     vendor  ◀── needs scheduler ──  vendor-react
   *
   * The browser began evaluating `vendor-react`, which re-entered `vendor`
   * before React's export binding had been assigned. Rollup emits that binding
   * as a hoisted `var`, so it read `undefined` rather than throwing a TDZ error,
   * and TanStack Query's top-level `createContext` died on it:
   * "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'createContext')". It throws
   * during module evaluation, before React renders anything, so neither the root
   * ErrorBoundary nor the per-route one could catch it. Blank page, no message.
   *
   * The cycle was latent for as long as nothing in `vendor` touched React at
   * import time. Phase 2 added TanStack Query, Radix and React Hook Form — all
   * of which do — and it fired. The `feature-*` buckets were circular too
   * (settings → hr → wms → fleet → settings); they were next.
   *
   * THE RULE, and it is the whole strategy:
   *
   *   1. ONE manual bucket, `vendor`. A single bucket cannot import itself, so
   *      it is acyclic by construction. Do NOT split node_modules into two or
   *      more named chunks: that requires proving no edge runs backwards, and
   *      you cannot prove that against a lockfile that moves. To keep something
   *      out of the first-load payload, exclude it (ROUTE_LOCAL_VENDOR above)
   *      and let Rollup place it — never give it a bucket of its own.
   *
   *   2. App code is NOT partitioned by hand at all. Route-level React.lazy in
   *      app/app.tsx makes every screen a dynamic import, and Rollup derives
   *      those chunks from the real graph — correctly, and without a config
   *      change each time a feature area is added.
   *
   * `onwarn` makes a violation fail the build, and `npm run check:bundle`
   * re-checks the emitted artifact. Both run in CI.
