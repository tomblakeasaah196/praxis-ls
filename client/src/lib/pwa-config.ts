/**
 * THE WINDOW FRAME IS THE MANIFEST'S, UNTIL SOMETHING CHANGES AFTER LOAD.
 *
 * An installed window has two painters. The page draws the title-bar strip
 * (`--titlebar-bg`); the browser draws what the page may not — the rounded top
 * corners and the band behind the minimise/maximise/close buttons — and it
 * takes that colour from the manifest's `theme_color`, letting the page's
 * `<meta name="theme-color">` override it.
 *
 * The override only lands on a change the browser observes AFTER the document
 * has loaded. Everything this app writes before then — the pre-paint script in
 * index.html, and this module's first call while the bundle is still booting —
 * is folded into the initial load and loses to the manifest. So on every
 * refresh the frame came back as whatever `theme_color` says, which the server
 * resolves against the TENANT's default theme (`brand_theme`), not the user's:
 * a dark-mode user in a light-default workspace got a white frame around a dark
 * app, and the only way out was to toggle light → dark, because THAT is a
 * post-load change. This does the same thing without the toggle.
 *
 * Detaching and re-inserting the element is what makes it a real transition
 * rather than a repeat of a value the browser has already dismissed: the
 * removal reports "no theme colour" (the frame falls back to the manifest) and
 * the insertion reports ours. Both happen in one synchronous task, so no frame
 * is ever painted with the tag missing.
 *
 * ONCE PER TAG, which is once per document: the tag outlives every branding
 * change, and re-running this on each one would detach and reattach the element
 * on every keystroke in the colour picker. Tracked against the element rather
 * than in a module-level flag so the guard is tied to the thing it is actually
 * about — a replaced tag is a new document's tag, and needs the poke again.
