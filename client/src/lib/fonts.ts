/**
 * THE FONT LIBRARY — the closed set of families the ERP ships.
 *
 * WHY A CLOSED SET. Appearance used to take three free-text CSS strings. A typo
 * ("Montserat") failed silently to the fallback, and even a correct name only
 * worked if the font happened to be installed on the viewer's machine — so a
 * tenant configured their brand type on a designer's Mac and every operator on
 * Windows saw something else. Every family below is self-hosted, so what the
 * tenant picks is what every user renders, on every device, offline included.
 *
 * All but one are @fontsource packages under SIL OFL / Apache-2.0. The
 * exception is Brittany Signature, a commercial script vendored under
 * client/src/fonts for the email signature card's motto; see the note on its
 * entry below and in that directory's CSS.
 *
 * WHY NO SEGOE UI / SF PRO / HELVETICA NEUE. All three are proprietary —
 * Microsoft, Apple and Monotype respectively — and cannot legally be
 * redistributed. Offering them would mean shipping a name that renders natively
 * on one OS and silently substitutes on every other, which is the exact failure
 * this library exists to end. Their open counterparts are here instead: Noto
 * Sans, Plus Jakarta Sans and Work Sans.
 *
 * WHAT IS PERSISTED. The `stack` string, not the id — it is written straight
 * into `--font-display` / `--font-body` / `--font-mono` (see lib/theme.ts), so
 * the storage contract is unchanged and any value already in the `setting`
 * table stays valid. `fontByValue()` resolves a stored string back to a library
 * entry, matching on the first family name, so a legacy hand-typed
 * `"Montserrat", Georgia, serif` resolves to Montserrat and starts loading the
 * real webfont rather than continuing to fall back to Georgia.
 *
 * LOADING IS LAZY. Nothing here is in the startup bundle except the active
 * fonts (see `loadFonts`). Each `load()` is a dynamic import of the family's
 * CSS, which Vite code-splits into its own chunk; the woff2 files it references
 * land in dist/assets, where the service worker's `**\/*.woff2` precache glob
 * picks them up. Eagerly bundling all sixteen would be ~3 MB on first paint for
 * a set where a tenant uses at most three.

 * library makes: system-ui resolves to a DIFFERENT typeface per operating
 * system, which is the per-device inconsistency this whole change exists to
 * remove. A bare generic keyword hands the choice to the browser for the one
 * moment it matters — the swap window before the real face arrives, which after
 * the first load is served from cache and is effectively zero.
