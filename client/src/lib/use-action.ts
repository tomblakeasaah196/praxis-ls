/**
 * `useAction` — the wrapper for mutations and click-triggered async reads.
 *
 * Its job is to make three things impossible to get wrong at once:
 *
 *   1. A mutation that succeeds tells the user (`success`).
 *   2. A mutation that is a no-op tells the user, differently (`idle`).
 *   3. An UNEXPECTED failure reaches the error monitor; an EXPECTED one
 *      (a 4xx, a config missing, a dropped network) does NOT.
 *
 * The five-line before-and-after in doc/ERROR_HANDLING.md is not marketing —
 * the reported session-kill bug was three stacked defects, and this hook shape
 * closes the last two of them (no success feedback, no `changed:false`
 * feedback). The `try/catch/setError` shape it replaces was twelve lines and
 * got both wrong.
 *
 * @example  // The common mutation shape.
 * const revoke = useAction(
 *   (id: string) => tenant(`/sessions/${id}/kill`, { method: "POST" }),
 *   {
 *     success: "Session revoked",
 *     idle: "That session was already revoked",
 *     onSuccess: () => { mine.reload(); all.reload(); },
 *   },
 * );
 * // …
 * <Button loading={revoke.busy} onClick={() => revoke.run(id)}>Revoke</Button>
 * {revoke.error && <ErrorState message={revoke.error} />}
 *
 * @example  // Background / fire-and-forget — silent to the user, visible to us.
 * const markRead = useAction(() => api.markThreadRead(id), { onError: "notice" });
 *
 * @example  // A read triggered by a click (export/print/refresh) still counts.
 * const exportCsv = useAction(
 *   () => tenantDownload("/invoices.csv", "invoices.csv"),
 *   { success: "Export ready" },
 * );
