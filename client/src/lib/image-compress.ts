/**
 * Browser-side image compression — the first half of the upload engine.
 *
 * WHY COMPRESS HERE when the server compresses too. Because the server's pass
 * happens AFTER the bytes have crossed the network, and the bytes crossing the
 * network are the wait the user is watching on the progress bar. A 6 MB phone
 * photo on a 3G connection in the corridor is roughly a 40-second upload; the
 * same photo resized here first is about 400 KB and lands in under three. The
 * server pass still runs and is still authoritative — a client that skipped
 * this (an API caller, a future mobile app, someone with a devtools console)
 * must never be able to plant an unprocessed original in storage.
 *
 * WHY WEBP, and why NOT always. `canvas.toBlob` supports "image/webp" in every
 * browser we serve and supports AVIF in none of them, so WebP is the only
 * modern format available on this side; the server adds AVIF afterwards.
 *
 * But the format the client emits becomes the format of the stored MASTER, and
 * the master is what a download hands back. An agent who forwards a customs
 * declaration to a broker, a bank or a government e-portal cannot send a .webp
 * to systems that refuse it. So the rule is by purpose, not global:
 *
 *   document / brand  → re-encode in the SOURCE format (JPEG stays JPEG)
 *   photo / avatar    → re-encode as WebP
 *
 * `brand` is in the first group deliberately: a logo is capped at 512 KB
 * anyway, so there is no byte argument worth trading the tenant's ability to
 * download their own asset for.
 *
 * FAILURE IS ALWAYS "SEND THE ORIGINAL". Every path in this file degrades to
 * the untouched File. A compression bug must cost bytes, never an upload.
