/**
 * The shell's first paint, and what to do when the answer behind it moves.
 *
 * WHY A CACHE AT ALL. `GET /permissions/mine` decides how many tabs the ribbon
 * has and which shortcuts the rail holds — that is, it decides the HEIGHT and
 * the contents of two bands of chrome that every screen renders inside. A shell
 * that waits for it renders nothing, then 93px of ribbon, and the content column
 * jumps down the page on every cold start. So the last answer is remembered and
 * drawn immediately, and the network read revalidates behind it.
 *
 * THE PRECEDENT IS ALREADY IN THIS CODEBASE. `praxis.titlebar.{dark,light}`
 * (lib/pwa-config.ts) remembers the resolved title-bar colour so the pre-boot
 * frame in index.html paints the tenant's bar instead of guessing white. Same
 * shape of problem, same shape of answer: cache the resolved value of a
 * network-derived piece of CHROME, because the alternative is a visible wrong
 * first frame.
 *
 * ── WHY THE KEY CARRIES A USER ID ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Two people share a machine far more often in a logistics office than in a
 * consumer app — a dispatch desk, a warehouse terminal, a shared workstation on
 * a night shift. A single unkeyed record would paint the previous user's ribbon
 * for the first frame of the next user's session. That frame is not merely wrong,
 * it names modules the incoming user may have no business knowing exist. Keyed
 * per user, a cold user is a cache MISS and gets the skeleton.
 *
 * It is still only a hint about CHROME. Nothing here is an authorisation
 * decision: the API refuses what it refuses regardless of what this file
 * remembers, and a tampered record buys a wrong-looking ribbon over screens that
 * still 403.
 *
 * ── GRANT vs REVOCATION ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `classifyAccessChange` is the whole reason the endpoint returns `modules` and
 * not just `version`. The digest says "something changed"; only the sets say
 * WHICH, and the two cases must not be handled the same way:
 *
 *   REVOCATION — a hard refresh, at once. A user must not keep interacting with
 *   a view of a module they are no longer authorised to see, and unsaved work in
 *   that view is work they are no longer entitled to submit.
 *
 *   GRANT — a banner, and nothing else. Gaining a module cannot expose anything,
 *   so there is no security clock running, and destroying whatever somebody is
 *   halfway through typing to deliver good news is a straight loss.
 *
 * A change that both gains and loses counts as a REVOCATION. Security decides
 * first; the gain is picked up by the same reload.

 * that painted the cached ribbon at the default height and then learned the user
 * had collapsed it would shift by a whole row — reintroducing, through the back
 * door, exactly the jump the access cache exists to remove.
 *
 * Not per user: unlike the module set it says nothing about anyone's access, and
