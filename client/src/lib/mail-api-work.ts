/**
 * Mail API — PR-3 (binding & collaboration), PR-4 (AI) and PR-5 (workflow,
 * security, compliance).
 *
 * Split out of `mail-api.ts`, which had grown past a thousand lines and where
 * this section was the part nobody could see the shape of.
 *
 * ── THE DEFECT THIS FILE WAS EXTRACTED TO FIX ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every write in the old PR-3/4/5 block was written as
 *
 *     tenant(path, { method: "POST", body: JSON.stringify(payload) })
 *
 * and `api-client.ts` already does `JSON.stringify(body)` itself, so the server
 * received a JSON *string literal* rather than an object. Express's json parser
 * runs `strict: true` by default and rejects a non-object top level, so every
 * one of those calls 400'd before it reached a route. The rest of `mail-api.ts`
 * had always used `body: payload`; this section was written against a mental
 * model of `fetch` and never exercised end to end.
 *
 * `tests/mail-api-encoding.test.ts` now fails the build on a reintroduction,
 * because the symptom — a 400 with no server-side log line, on every write in
 * one feature area — reads as "the backend is broken" and sends whoever hits it
 * to the wrong half of the stack.
 *
 * ── CONVENTIONS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * · `body:` takes the OBJECT. Never a string.
 * · Response types are declared where the UI depends on the shape. Where the
 *   server returns a passthrough row that only gets rendered as JSON, `unknown`
 *   is honest and a fabricated interface is not.
 * · Anything that spends money on a model call is a POST, including reads like
 *   the thread summary — a GET that can bill the tenant is one a prefetcher
 *   will bill them for twice.
