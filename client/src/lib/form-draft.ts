/**
 * Form drafts — what you typed survives a network drop, a crash and a reload.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. "I was filling a form, it means I have lost it." That is the
 * actual report, and it was correct: nothing in this client persisted an
 * in-progress form anywhere. A dropped connection, a chunk-reload after a
 * deploy, an ErrorBoundary catch, a closed laptop — every one of them threw the
 * work away, and the only recovery offered was "Reload the page", which is the
 * instruction that guarantees the loss. `error-boundary.tsx` even names this
 * ("a manual reload — which in this app also means losing an unsaved form") and
 * then had nothing to hand it.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT. It is not offline data entry and it is not a sync engine.
 * A draft is a local copy of the fields as typed, restored on the same device,
 * for the same user, into the same form. It has never been near the server and
 * carries no id the server would recognise — sending it is the outbox's job
 * (`lib/outbox.ts`), and the two are deliberately separate: a draft is
 * "unfinished", an outbox entry is "finished and awaiting the network".
 *
 * SECRETS ARE NEVER WRITTEN. `localStorage` is readable by any script on the
 * origin and survives sign-out, so anything that looks like a credential is
 * dropped on the way in — see `REDACT`. A password field that autosaved would
 * turn a convenience into a vulnerability, and "the developer will remember to
 * pass `exclude`" is not a control.
 *
 * @example  // any form, controlled or RHF
 * const draft = useFormDraft({ key: `entity:${id ?? "new"}`, values, label: "Corporate entity" });
 * // …restore banner
 * {draft.pending && <DraftBanner draft={draft} onRestore={(v) => reset(v)} />}
 * // …after a successful save
 * draft.clear();
