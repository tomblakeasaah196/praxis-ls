/**
 * Vaulted-file plumbing — reading a file off disk on its way IN, and opening a
 * stored one on its way OUT.
 *
 * Both halves existed already, each in one place and nowhere else: `document-
 * view.tsx` could open a vaulted PDF, and the entity dossier could upload one.
 * Neither could do the other, and no other screen could do either — which is why
 * a client or supplier KYC document had no way to receive a scan at all, and why
 * a scan attached to a corporate entity could never be looked at again.
 *
 * The upload itself is `masterdata-api.uploadVaultDocument` (POST /documents,
 * MOD-64). What lives here is everything around it that has no business being
 * re-typed per screen: the browser-side file read, the size/type guard that
 * turns a doomed 25 MB upload into an instant message, and the auth-gated
 * download — a plain `<a href>` cannot carry the bearer token, so the bytes are
 * fetched and handed to the tab as a blob URL.
