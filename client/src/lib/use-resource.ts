/**
 * Shared data-fetch hooks — the four-states helper every wired screen uses.
 *
 * `useList(path)` fetches a tenant list endpoint into `{ rows, error, loading,
 * reload }`; `useResource(fn, deps)` does the same for a single/custom fetch.
 * 403 becomes a permission message (never a crash), matching FE_DESIGN_RULES §3.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * PHASE 2 (audit F8 / F16): these are now THIN SHIMS OVER TANSTACK QUERY.
 *
 * The public shape is deliberately byte-for-byte what it was, because 161 call
 * sites depend on it and this migration has to be incremental — a screen gets
 * caching, request deduplication and stale-while-revalidate without being
 * touched. New code that needs pagination, infinite lists, mutations or
 * optimistic updates should use `useQuery`/`useMutation` from
 * `@tanstack/react-query` directly rather than extending these.
 *
 * `error` is a FORMATTED STRING, not an Error. That is the contract, and 16
 * sites used to pass it through `errMsg()` a second time — which, because a
 * string is not an `ApiError`, fell to the default branch and replaced the real
 * server message (403 permission text included) with "Something went wrong."
 * Those are fixed; do not reintroduce the pattern. `errMsg` is for a caught
 * exception, never for the `error` these hooks return.

 * `features/finance/pages.tsx:92`, `features/settings/master-data-pages.tsx:19`
 * and `features/settings/config-pages.tsx:23`).
 *
 * Five of the six were byte-identical. The sixth — Finance's `errMessage` — was
 * BETTER: it unpacked a 422's `details` into "field: message" instead of
 * showing the generic validation banner. Consolidating kept that behaviour and
 * gave it to the other five, rather than flattening to the lowest common
 * version. Every write surface in the ERP now tells the user WHICH field the
 * server rejected.
 *
 * (Routing those messages to the offending inputs rather than into one banner
 * is the remaining half of F12, and belongs to the Field/RHF work in PR2.)
 *
 * F-GAP-09 — WHY 403 NO LONGER DISCARDS THE SERVER'S SENTENCE.
 *
 * Every 403 used to render as the generic sentence below, whatever the server
 * said. The authorization layer goes to real trouble to write messages that name
 * the remedy, and all of them died here:
 *
 *   SELF_ROLE_CHANGE      "You cannot change your own roles. Ask another administrator."
 *   SELF_GRANT_FORBIDDEN  "You cannot grant yourself the APPROVER authority — another must."
 *   SELF_APPROVAL         "You raised this change — it must be approved by someone else."
 *   ROLE_ESCALATION       "You cannot grant Finance because you do not hold it."
 *   PRIVILEGED_TARGET     "Only a CEO can set a CEO's password…"
 *   NOT_ELIGIBLE          "This step requires the APPROVER authority"
 *   PERMISSION_DENIED     "No permission for MOD-03.approve"
 *
 * Observed cost: an administrator hit maker-checker on a client activation, was
 * told they lacked permission, and went hunting for a grant that was not the
 * problem. Three of those messages are not about a missing grant at all — they
 * are about WHO is acting, which no amount of granting will fix. Flattening them
 * sends the reader in the wrong direction, confidently.
 *
 * Note the asymmetry this removes: 422 field errors were already unpacked one
 * branch down. 403 was the only class blanked — the one where the server most
 * reliably knows the remedy.
 *
 * The generic sentence stays as the FALLBACK, for a 403 that carries no message.
 * Same shape as the `return e.message || …` on the last branch: prefer what the
 * server said, keep a sentence for when it said nothing.
 *
 * Call this in a `catch` block. Do NOT call it on the `error` string returned
 * by `useList`/`useResource` — that has already been through here.

 * The API's error CODE, for screens that must branch on WHICH failure occurred.

 *
 * `error` is a formatted sentence, and that is the right default — screens
 * should display it, not parse it. But four screens needed to distinguish two
 * genuinely different failures, and with only a sentence available they did the
 * only thing they could: regex the prose.
 *
 *     // features/vault/pages.tsx, before
 *     const isGated = (msg) => /feature|not enabled|disabled|forbidden|permission/i.test(msg);
 *
 * `errMsg` renders EVERY 403 as "You don't have permission to do this.", which
 * matches `/permission/`. So a user who simply lacked the reports grant was told
 * **"Reporting isn't enabled for this tenant"** — and pointed at a developer
 * dashboard feature flag that was already on. They would ask an admin to enable
 * a feature that is enabled; the admin would look in the wrong place; the actual
 * cause — a missing role grant — is never mentioned. It is the same shape as the
 * Control Tower defect Addendum 6 records, where a 403 rendered as "All clear".
 *
 * The backend has always distinguished these properly:
 *   FEATURE_DISABLED  middleware/feature-gate.js — the tenant does not have it
 *   FORBIDDEN         the caller does not have the grant
 *
 * So the discriminator existed at the source and was being thrown away one layer
 * from the screen. This exposes it. `error` is unchanged, so the 161 call sites
 * that only display it are untouched.
