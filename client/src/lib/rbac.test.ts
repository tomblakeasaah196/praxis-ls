/**
 * F-GAP-11 — the permission matrix could not save a grant that already existed.
 *
 * `upsertGrant` used to send the object it was handed (`body: g`), and what the
 * matrix hands it is a full database row: `/permissions/matrix` returns
 * `RETURNING *`, so every loaded grant carries `permission_id`. The `Grant`
 * annotation is erased at runtime and strips nothing. The server's validator is
 * `.strict()` — deliberately, because a misspelled `can_aprove` silently written
 * as `false` is a privilege change nobody asked for — so it answered
 * 422 "Unrecognized key(s) in object: 'permission_id'".
 *
 * Net effect: the screen you fix permissions on could not be used to fix
 * permissions. A cell with no row saved once (emptyGrant builds a clean object),
 * then its own `RETURNING *` response was stored in state and the second toggle
 * of that same cell failed.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A TEST AND NOT A LINE IN check-schemas.mjs. That gate asks
 * whether a schema in `packages/shared` is imported by both halves — an
 * organisational question, answered statically. This is a wire-contract
 * question: what does this one call actually put on the request. Pinning the
 * payload is the check that would have caught the defect, and it fails loudly at
 * the call site rather than in a build script that has to infer the pairing.
 *
 * `permission_id` is not merely unwanted, it is unusable: the repo binds the
 * flags by name and resolves the row by ON CONFLICT (role_id, module_key), the
 * natural key. The id is database-generated and never in the DO UPDATE SET list.

 * `can_disburse` and `can_export` to `PERMS`, to `Grant` and to the server
 * schema but not to the body `upsertGrant` builds, and no status code
 * complained — the repo COALESCEs an absent flag to "unchanged", so those three
 * columns simply could not be edited from the matrix.
