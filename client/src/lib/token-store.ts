/**
 * Token store. Access token lives in memory only (lost on reload — refreshed
 * from the refresh token on boot). Refresh token persistence depends on the
 * user's "Keep me signed in" choice:
 *   • checked  → refresh in localStorage (survives reload / new tab / restart)
 *   • unchecked → refresh in sessionStorage (gone when the tab/window closes)
 * Either way a reload within the same session restores the session; closing the
 * browser only keeps you in when you asked to be kept in.
 *
 * NOTE (security tradeoff, flagged for the team): a refresh token in web storage
 * is readable by any XSS on the page. Acceptable for the scaffold; revisit with
 * httpOnly-cookie refresh + CSRF if the threat model demands it. Everything
 * funnels through here so that swap is a one-file change.
