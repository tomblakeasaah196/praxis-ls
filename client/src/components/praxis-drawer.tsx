/**
 * Praxis AI — the side drawer. Mounted once in the app shell, so it rides along
 * on every screen in the product.
 *
 * WHAT THIS REPLACES, AND WHY. The previous surface (`praxis-copilot.tsx`) was a
 * 380×560 floating card pinned above the FAB. Three things were wrong with it,
 * and all three are structural rather than cosmetic:
 *
 *   IT SAT ON THE WORK. `fixed bottom-40 right-5` is where a list screen's last
 *   rows and its pager are — the same objection the audit raised against the
 *   draggable FAB (F9). A panel you have to move to read the thing you are
 *   asking about is a panel fighting its own purpose.
 *
 *   IT WAS A FIXED, SMALL BOX. An answer with a table in it, or a proposed
 *   action with eight fields, had 380px and no way to ask for more. The drawer
 *   is drag-resizable and remembers where you put it.
 *
 *   IT WAS A HAND-ROLLED PANEL. No focus trap, no restoration, no scroll lock —
 *   exactly the set of failures `ui/dialog.tsx` documents and Radix solves. This
 *   is built on the same Radix primitive, so the drawer gets them for free.
 *
 * EVERY OPEN IS A NEW THREAD. This is the decision that most changes how the
 * drawer feels. You open it FROM a screen, ABOUT that screen; inheriting
 * yesterday's conversation about receivables into a question about a delivery
 * note is what made the old panel feel like it was not listening. Nothing is
 * lost — the thread is persisted server-side the moment you send, and past
 * conversations live on the full page, which is where browsing them belongs and
 * where there is room to do it. The drawer is for the question you have now.
 *
 * THE MIDDLE BUTTON IS THE HINGE. Header controls are New chat · Expand · Close,
 * and the middle one carries the current thread into `/ai`, so "this needs more
 * room" costs one click and loses nothing.
 *
 * OVERLAY, NOT PUSH. It dims the page rather than reflowing it: a drawer that
 * squeezes the layout re-lays-out every table underneath it on open, on close,
 * and on every pixel of a resize drag.

          are asking about the screen it is sitting over, and the context chip
          says so by name. Frosting that screen removes the thing the question
          is about. `ui/dialog.tsx` blurs because a modal WANTS your attention

          CONTENT IS A DIRECT CHILD OF PORTAL, and it has to be.

          This was `<DrawerBody/>` — a plain function component wrapping
          `Dialog.Content` — and that is what broke the drawer: `DialogPortal`
          wraps every child in `<Presence>`, which clones it with a ref to track
          mount/unmount. A component that is not `forwardRef` swallows that ref,
          so Radix never registers the content layer. In modal mode it is that
          registration that flips `pointer-events` back on for the dialog while
          the rest of the document stays inert — miss it and NOTHING is
          clickable, the drawer included, which is exactly how it presented.

          So `Content` lives here, and the width state it needs lives here with
          it. `DrawerBody` keeps the conversation and is now an ordinary child
          INSIDE the content, where being a function component costs nothing.

          Note it is written INLINE rather than as a `<DrawerShell>` — extracting
          it for tidiness would put a function component back between `Portal`
          and `Content` and reintroduce the same bug one level up.

            or nobody catches it on the way past.

            It is a FOCUSABLE separator with `aria-valuenow`, which is what makes
            it operable without a pointer — arrows move it 16px, Shift+arrows
            64px, and a screen reader announces the width against its range.
            That is the reason for the `jsx-a11y` suppression: the rule treats
            `role="separator"` as non-interactive, but a separator WITH
            `tabindex` and `aria-valuenow` is exactly the interactive variant
            the ARIA spec defines for this, and the `<button>` it would push us
