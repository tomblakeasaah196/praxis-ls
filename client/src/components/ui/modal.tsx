/**
 * Modal — now an ALIAS of `<Dialog>` (components/ui/dialog.tsx).

 * The hand-rolled implementation that lived here handled Escape and body-scroll
 * lock and nothing else. It had NO FOCUS TRAP (Tab moved focus behind the
 * dialog, into controls the backdrop hid) and NO FOCUS RESTORATION (on close,
 * focus was lost to <body>) — WCAG 2.1 §2.4.3, at every write surface in the
 * product (audit F13).
 *
 * Rather than edit the 56 files that import `Modal`, this re-exports the Radix
 * implementation under the old name and the identical prop contract, so all 56
 * inherit the focus trap, focus restore and proper `aria-labelledby` /
 * `aria-describedby` wiring without being touched. Same incremental-shim
 * approach as `lib/use-resource`.
 *
 * NEW CODE SHOULD IMPORT `Dialog` DIRECTLY. This alias exists to carry the
 * existing screens across, not to be the long-term name.

/**
 * Field — labelled form control: label on top, control below, optional hint or
 * error underneath.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * THE BIGGEST SINGLE ACCESSIBILITY FIX IN THE AUDIT (F4).
 *
 * This wrapper is used by essentially every write form in the product. It used
 * to render a `<label>` with no `htmlFor` against children with no `id`:
 *
 *     <label className="text-sm font-medium">{label}</label>   // points at nothing
 *     {children}                                               // no id, no aria-*
 *
 * The label wrapped nothing and pointed at nothing. Measured across the client:
 *
 *     <Field> render sites                              565
 *     …with label→control association                     0
 *     …passing `required` (a red asterisk and nothing else) 189
 *     …passing `error`                                      4
 *     aria-required / aria-invalid / aria-describedby
 *       anywhere in ~40,000 lines                       0 / 0 / 0
 *
 * That fails WCAG 2.1 §1.3.1 (Info and Relationships), §3.3.2 (Labels or
 * Instructions) and §4.1.2 (Name, Role, Value) at every write surface in an
 * ERP that posts journal entries and runs payroll. A screen-reader user heard
 * "edit text, blank" 565 times; clicking a label did not focus its input;
 * required-ness was conveyed by a red asterisk and nothing else.
 *
 * Because it is one component, the fix is one component.
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * HOW IT ASSOCIATES. `useId` mints a stable id per field. The child is cloned
 * with that `id` plus the ARIA state, and the label points at it with `htmlFor`.
 * Both association routes are wired deliberately:
 *
 *   htmlFor          gives click-the-label-to-focus, and works for the labelable
 *                    natives (input / select / textarea) that most fields hold.
 *   aria-labelledby  gives the accessible NAME to anything else — a
 *                    `role="radiogroup"` (Segmented), a `role="combobox"`
 *                    (SearchSelect), a composite widget. `htmlFor` cannot
 *                    associate with a div, so on its own it would have left
 *                    every non-native control unnamed.
 *
 * A child that already carries its own `id` keeps it, and the label follows it
 * rather than overwriting.
 *
 * WHEN THE CHILD ISN'T A SINGLE ELEMENT (a fragment, or two inputs side by
 * side) there is nothing to clone, so the children are wrapped in a
 * `role="group"` labelled by the same text. That is the correct pattern for a
 * composite field and keeps the group named rather than silently unlabelled.
 *
 * @example
 * <Field label="Client" required>
 *   <Input value={form.name} onChange={(e) => set("name", e.target.value)} />
 * </Field>
 *
 * @example  // with server-side validation routed to the field
 * <Field label="Amount" required error={errors.amount} hint="Excluding TVA.">
 *   <Input inputMode="decimal" value={form.amount} onChange={…} />
 * </Field>
 *
 * BEST PRACTICE. `label` is required and should be a noun phrase ("Payment
 * due"), not an instruction ("Enter the payment due date") — put that in
 * `hint`, which is announced after the label rather than instead of it. Pass
 * `error` rather than rendering your own message below the field: only then do
 * `aria-invalid` and `aria-describedby` point at it, which is what makes a
 * screen reader announce the problem when focus lands on the control. Never use
 * `placeholder` as the label — it disappears on the first keystroke.
