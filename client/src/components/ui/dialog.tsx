/**
 * Dialog — the modal shell every write form and detail view opens into.
 *
 * WHY RADIX (audit F13). The previous hand-rolled `Modal` handled Escape and
 * body-scroll lock and nothing else:
 *
 *   - NO FOCUS TRAP. Tab moved focus behind the dialog, into the page the
 *     dialog was covering, while the backdrop still blocked the mouse. A
 *     keyboard user could tab into controls they could not see.
 *   - NO FOCUS RESTORATION. On close, focus was lost to <body> — so the next
 *     Tab started from the top of the document. WCAG 2.1 §2.4.3 (Focus Order).
 *   - The dialog was labelled with `aria-label={title}` while a visible <h2>
 *     carried the same text, and `description` was never associated at all.
 *
 * This affected every write form in the product. Radix solves exactly this set
 * correctly — trap, restore, `aria-labelledby`/`aria-describedby` wiring,
 * inert-ing the background, and Escape — and it is HEADLESS, so the visual
 * system below is unchanged. That is the whole reason the audit says adopt
 * Radix and NOT a styled kit: the look already exists and works.
 *
 * The API is deliberately identical to the old `Modal`, so the ~100 call sites
 * migrate by changing an import. Structure is the same three regions that made
 * tall content behave: a STICKY header (title + close + optional `headerRight`),
 * a SCROLLABLE body, and an optional STICKY `footer`. On mobile it is a bottom
 * sheet; on sm+ a centred dialog.
 *
 * @example
 * <Dialog open={open} onClose={() => setOpen(false)} title="New client"
 *         description="Creates a master-data record."
 *         footer={<FormButtons busy={saving} onCancel={close} saveLabel="Create client" />}>
 *   <Field label="Name" required><Input … /></Field>
 * </Dialog>
 *
 * BEST PRACTICE. Give every dialog a `title` that names the OUTCOME ("Post
 * journal entry"), not the mechanism ("Form"). Put the primary action in
 * `footer` so it stays visible while the body scrolls — a Save button that
 * scrolls out of a 40-field form is how half-filled records happen. For a
 * destructive action set `destructive` so the confirm reads as a warning.
 * Do not nest dialogs; open the second from a row action after the first closes.

   *

   * makes the behaviour deterministic rather than dependent on what happened to
   * be focused when the portal mounted. WCAG 2.1 §2.4.3 — the failure being
