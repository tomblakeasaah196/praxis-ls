/**
 * Popover — a panel anchored to a trigger, holding CONTENT rather than actions.
 *
 * The distinction from `<DropdownMenu>` is not cosmetic, and getting it wrong
 * is what `notification-bell.tsx:111` did (audit F13): it declared
 * `role="menu"` over a scrollable list of notifications, each row carrying its
 * own "mark read" button. A `menuitem` may not contain interactive children —
 * so that markup promised menu keyboard semantics it did not implement AND
 * nested buttons where none are allowed.
 *
 *   DropdownMenu  a list of actions/destinations, one activation each, arrow
 *                 keys move between them.
 *   Popover       a panel of content: text, a list with its own controls, a
 *                 small form. Tab moves through it like ordinary content.
 *
 * Radix gives the popover what the hand-rolled version lacked: focus moves into
 * the panel on open and RETURNS to the trigger on close, Escape closes,
 * outside-click closes, and the trigger carries `aria-expanded` /
 * `aria-controls` so its state is announced.
 *
 * @example
 * <Popover trigger={<button aria-label="Notifications"><BellIcon /></button>} label="Notifications">
 *   <NotificationList />
 * </Popover>
 *
 * BEST PRACTICE. Give `label` a name matching the trigger's purpose — it is
 * what a screen reader announces on entering the panel. Keep a popover under
 * roughly a screen-third tall and scroll inside it; past that the content
 * wants a page or a Dialog. Do not put a destructive confirmation in one — an
 * outside click dismisses it, which is the wrong default for an irreversible
 * action.
