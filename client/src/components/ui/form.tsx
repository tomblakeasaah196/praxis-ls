/**
 * Form — React Hook Form + Zod, wired to the `Field` accessibility fix.
 *
 * WHY (audit F4 / F12). Two findings meet here:
 *
 *   - 4 of 565 `<Field>`s ever received an `error`. Validation was enforced
 *     server-side and surfaced as ONE banner string, so the user was told
 *     something was wrong but not WHICH field. `finance/pages.tsx:92` even
 *     parsed a 422's `details` into "field: message" text — and then flattened
 *     it into a single sentence rather than routing it to the offending input.
 *   - There was no form library and no schema sharing. The backend validates
 *     with Zod; the client re-implemented the same rules as ad-hoc booleans
 *     (`finance/pages.tsx:141`'s `canSubmit`), which drift.
 *
 * `useZodForm` takes a schema from `@shared` — the SAME object the Express
 * validator parses with — so the client cannot disagree with the API about what
 * is valid. `<FormField>` then routes each message to its own control, where
 * `Field` turns it into `aria-invalid` + `aria-describedby`.
 *
 * @example
 * import { finalInvoice } from "@shared";
 * import { useZodForm } from "@/lib/use-zod-form";
 *
 * function SubmitInvoiceForm({ onDone }: { onDone: () => void }) {
 *   const form = useZodForm(finalInvoice.submit, { defaultValues: { entry_date: todayISO(), source_doc_ref: "" } });
 *   const toast = useToast();
 *
 *   return (
 *     <Form
 *       form={form}
 *       onSubmit={async (values) => {
 *         await tenant(`/final-invoices/${id}/submit`, { method: "POST", body: values });
 *         toast.success("Invoice submitted");
 *         onDone();
 *       }}
 *     >
 *       <FormField form={form} name="entry_date" label="Entry date" required>
 *         {(field) => <Input type="date" {...field} />}
 *       </FormField>
 *       <FormField form={form} name="source_doc_ref" label="Document reference" required>
 *         {(field) => <Input {...field} />}
 *       </FormField>
 *       <FormError form={form} />
 *       <FormButtons busy={form.formState.isSubmitting} onCancel={onDone} saveLabel="Submit invoice" />
 *     </Form>
 *   );
 * }
 *
 * BEST PRACTICE. Validate on `submit`, not on every keystroke — telling someone
 * their email is invalid while they are still typing it is the single most
 * disliked form behaviour there is. `mode: "onTouched"` below re-validates a
 * field once the user has left it AND a submit has failed, which is the
 * behaviour people actually want. Never add a client-side rule the schema does
 * not have: put it in `packages/shared` so the API enforces it too, or it is
 * not a rule, it is a suggestion.
