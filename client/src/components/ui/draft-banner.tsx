/**
 * DraftBanner — "you were part-way through this last time; want it back?"
 *
 * The visible half of `lib/form-draft.ts`. Deliberately an OFFER, never an
 * automatic restore: silently repopulating a form with values from an earlier
 * sitting is how somebody edits the wrong record, and in a system of record
 * that is worse than retyping. The user says yes.
 *
 * It also gives the user a way to say NO and mean it — `onDiscard` deletes the
 * stored draft rather than merely hiding this. A prompt that reappears on every
 * visit because dismissing it did nothing is a prompt people learn to click
 * past without reading.
 *
 * @example
 * const draft = useFormDraft({ key: `entity:${id ?? "new"}`, values: v, label: "Corporate entity" });
 * {draft.pending && (
 *   <DraftBanner
 *     savedAt={draft.pending.savedAt}
 *     onRestore={() => { const vals = draft.restore(); if (vals) setV(vals); }}
 *     onDiscard={draft.discard}
 *   />
 * )}
