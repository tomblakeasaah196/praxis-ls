/**
 * SplitPane — a resizable master-detail layout (Phase 5, audit F9).
 *
 * WHY. The four 360 screens (client, dossier, employee, location) all use
 * `lg:grid-cols-[260px_1fr]`: a fixed 260px index against a fluid detail. That
 * number was chosen once, for one viewport, and it is wrong in both directions —
 * too narrow for a list of French company names at 1280px, and absurd at 2560px
 * where the detail pane has room to spare and the index still truncates every
 * entry. A fixed pane on a screen whose whole job is comparison is the
 * "stretched mobile view" F2 opens with, one component down.
 *
 * IT IS A REAL SEPARATOR, NOT A DRAGGABLE DIV. `role="separator"` with
 * `aria-valuenow` / `aria-valuemin` / `aria-valuemax` and `aria-controls` is the
 * WAI-ARIA Window Splitter pattern: arrow keys move it in 16px steps, Home and
 * End take it to its limits, Enter collapses and restores. That matters because
 * a drag handle is the most common mouse-only-by-construction control on the
 * web — this app already shipped two (the FAB, the sales kanban) and both had to
 * be fixed after the fact. Building the third one operable was cheaper than
 * fixing it would have been.
 *
 * IT ONLY SPLITS ON DESKTOP. Below `lg` the panes stack and the separator is not
 * rendered — dragging a divider is not a phone gesture, and 260px of a 360px
 * viewport is not a layout. `lg` is where the existing grids already switched,
 * so no screen changes behaviour at a width it did not already change at.
 *
 * @example
 * <SplitPane storageKey="master.clients" label="Client list width">
 *   <ClientIndex … />
 *   <ClientDetail … />
 * </SplitPane>
 *
 * IT SAYS WHAT IS OPEN. `activeKind` bonds the two panes: the detail side grows
 * the same 3px accent rail that `<IndexRow>` draws on the selected row, plus an
 * eyebrow naming the KIND of record it holds. Before this, a split screen gave
 * the reader nothing — the open row was a 10% tint (invisible in the dark
 * theme) and the pane looked like an ordinary page that happened to sit on the
 * right. Two rails of one colour and one width read as ONE object, which is
 * what makes "this row opened that pane" legible at a glance rather than by
 * deduction.
 *
 * The eyebrow names the KIND and not the record. The record's own name is the
 * `<h1>` immediately below it, and printing it twice, 8px apart, is the
 * duplication `<Record360Header>` documents itself as avoiding. Pass
 * `activeKind` already translated — `tr("Service type")`, not "Service type".
 *
 * BEST PRACTICE. Give every instance its own `storageKey` — the right width for
 * a column of vehicle plates is not the right width for one of client names.
 * Set `min` at the point the index stops being READABLE, not merely visible.
