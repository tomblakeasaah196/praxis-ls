/**
 * Employee picker — server-side search, not a `<select>` over the roster.
 *
 * ── THE BUG THIS REPLACES ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The training roster built its "add attendee" dropdown from
 * `useList("/employees")`. That endpoint's `page()` clamps every list to 50
 * rows and, in the bare-array shape `useList` consumes, says nothing about the
 * rest. So on any tenant with more than fifty staff:
 *
 *   · the fifty-first employee onwards could not be added to a training AT ALL,
 *     because they were not in the list the dropdown was built from; and
 *   · they rendered on the existing roster as eight hex characters, because the
 *     screen was resolving ids against the same truncated map.
 *
 * Neither failed loudly. The dropdown looked complete, and the answer to "why
 * is Marie not in the list" was invisible from the screen.
 *
 * So this searches on the server (`/employees?q=`, matched against name, job
 * title and CNPS number) and never pretends to hold the whole roster. It shows
 * the first page of matches and says so — "keep typing to narrow" is honest
 * where a silently truncated dropdown is not.
