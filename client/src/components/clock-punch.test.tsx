/**
 * The title-bar clock chip.
 *
 * WHAT THESE PIN, and why each one is a bug that shipped or nearly did:
 *
 *   1. The chip is a real button with the SHIFT STATE in its accessible name.
 *      The visual signal is a 8px dot; a screen-reader user who only hears
 *      "Clock out" cannot tell whether that is an instruction or a description.
 *   2. Punching captures a GPS fix FIRST and still punches when the fix fails.
 *      The tenant `hr.geofence` policy decides whether a location-less punch is
 *      accepted; the client must not make that decision by refusing to send.
 *   3. A failed fix is REPORTED. The original swallowed it, so a user under the
 *      `warn` policy punched with no location and never knew.
 *   4. A user with no linked employee still sees a clock and is told why the
 *      punch did nothing, rather than seeing a dead control.
