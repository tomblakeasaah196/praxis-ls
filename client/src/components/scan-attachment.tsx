/**
 * ScanAttachment — the one control for putting a PDF or a photograph behind a
 * record, and for opening it again afterwards.
 *
 * WHY IT IS SHARED. Every master-data register keeps documents as two separate
 * things: the RECORD (type, number, issuing authority, expiry — what the
 * renewals engine reads) and the FILE (the scan itself, which lives in the
 * document vault, MOD-64). The record can exist without the file; that is
 * deliberate, since refusing to register a certificate you are holding because
 * it has not been scanned yet is how a register ends up incomplete.
 *
 * What was NOT deliberate is that the attaching half only existed on corporate
 * entities, hand-rolled inline, and the opening half only existed in the
 * document viewer. Clients and suppliers had a Scan column that could only ever
 * read PENDING, because nothing in the product could give a party document a
 * `vault_id` — the API accepted one the whole time (`_shared/nested.js` even
 * advances PENDING → SCANNED the moment it lands).
 *
 * The upload is two calls and always will be: the vault owns the bytes, hashes
 * them and audits them, and the document record only points at the result. This
 * component does the first call and hands back the id; the caller patches it
 * onto its own record, because only the caller knows what that record is.

/**
 * The same file picker as a FORM FIELD, for attaching during creation.
 *
 * `ScanAttachment` cannot serve this case: it uploads the moment a file is
 * picked, and a record being created has no id yet for the vault row to
 * reference or for the `vault_id` patch to land on. So this control only HOLDS
 * the file; the form uploads it after the record exists.
 *
 * It reads as a plain field on purpose. The modal is where an operator expects
 * to hand over everything they have about a document — the fact that the bytes
 * take a different path to the database than the expiry date does is our
 * problem, not theirs.
