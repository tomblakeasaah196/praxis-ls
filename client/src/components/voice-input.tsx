/**
 * Hold-to-talk, transcribed server-side.
 *
 * ── WHY NOT THE BROWSER'S OWN SPEECH API ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `webkitSpeechRecognition` is free and needs no round trip, and it is the wrong
 * choice here for three reasons that all bite the same user: it does not exist
 * in Firefox or in most installed-PWA webviews, it silently ships audio to the
 * browser vendor rather than to the provider this workspace configured, and its
 * accuracy on Nigerian and Cameroonian English is materially worse than
 * Whisper's. This records locally and posts the clip to the tenant's own
 * transcription provider.
 *
 * ── WHAT IT APPENDS, AND WHY IT NEVER REPLACES ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * Transcribed text is APPENDED to whatever is already in the field. Somebody
 * who types half an answer, then speaks the rest, must not lose the half they
 * typed — and somebody who records twice is adding a second thought, not
 * correcting the first. Replacing is destructive and unrecoverable; appending
 * is one Backspace away from either.
 *
 * ── FAILURE IS ALWAYS SAID OUT LOUD ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A mic button that does nothing is the worst outcome: people press it again,
 * and again, and conclude the product is broken. Every failure path here —
 * permission refused, no provider configured, a clip too short to contain
 * speech — produces a visible sentence telling them what happened and that they
 * can type instead.
