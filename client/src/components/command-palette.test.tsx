/**
 * ⌘K must not offer a door it knows is locked.
 *
 * WHY THIS SURFACE IN PARTICULAR. The ribbon and the rail were made
 * permission-aware first, which is the right order — they are what a user
 * looks at — and it left the palette as the widest unfiltered offer in the
 * product. It carries five curated jumps, every screen in NAV on a keystroke,
 * and four hard-coded actions, three of which land in Finance or Operations. A
 * warehouse role could reach four separate 403s from here without ever having
 * seen a menu that offered them, and each one looks like the product breaking
 * rather than the product refusing.
 *
 * The negative case at the bottom is the one that keeps this honest. Filtering
 * against an unanswered permissions read is indistinguishable from filtering
 * against a user who has nothing — and a palette that opens EMPTY on a slow
 * first login is a worse bug than the one this fixes, because the user
 * concludes the feature is broken and stops pressing the key.
