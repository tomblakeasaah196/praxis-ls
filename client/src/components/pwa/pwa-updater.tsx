/**
 * How often to ask the service worker to check for a new build.
 *
 * WHY WE POLL AT ALL. `registerType: "prompt"` fires `onNeedRefresh` only when
 * a new SW is DETECTED — and by default vite-plugin-pwa never proactively
 * asks. Chrome checks the sw.js file on tab navigation and on the browser's
 * own ~24 h cache TTL, so a user with a long-lived tab (the common ERP shape:
 * an operator leaves a dossier open all day) can sit on a stale bundle for
 * hours after a deploy, never seeing the "New version available" toast.
 *
 * Five minutes is short enough that a deploy is visible within one coffee
 * break, long enough that the polling cost is trivial (one HEAD-ish request
 * per user per five minutes). We also poll on tab-visible, so returning to a
 * tab that has been in the background immediately checks — the audit's
 * "leave a dossier open on one monitor for hours" note again.

   * Apply the update. We drive this ourselves instead of calling the plugin's

   *
   *   1. workbox-window's `messageSkipWaiting()` is
   *          if (this._registration && this._registration.waiting) { ...post... }
   *      — a silent no-op when `waiting` is null. No error, no reload, no
   *      feedback. Clicking again does nothing again, forever.
   *
   *   2. The reload itself is gated on `if (event.isUpdate)`, and `isUpdate` is
   *      latched ONCE at registration as `Boolean(navigator.serviceWorker
   *      .controller)`. A hard refresh (Ctrl+F5) BYPASSES the service worker,
   *      so the page loads uncontrolled, `controller` is null, `isUpdate` is
   *      false — and the reload line never runs. That is a trap with a latch:
   *      hard-refreshing to escape a stuck banner is exactly what guarantees
   *      the NEXT click is dead too.
   *
   * So: resolve the registration fresh (never a stale reference), talk to the
   * waiting worker directly, reload on `controllerchange` with no `isUpdate`
   * condition — and, above all, guarantee the click always ends in a reload.
   * A button that sometimes does nothing is the actual bug being fixed here.
