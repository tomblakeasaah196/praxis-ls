/**
 * The hub's tab strip is a FALLBACK, not an unconditional removal.
 *
 * THE STATE THIS EXISTS TO PREVENT. The ribbon's second row carries a hub's
 * sections, so the in-page strip is hidden on desktop — but the ribbon renders
 * nothing until the permissions read settles, and nothing at all if that read
 * failed. Hide the strip regardless and there is a state where a user is
 * standing inside a hub with no row B and no tabs: they cannot reach another
 * section of the screen they are already looking at, and nothing on screen says
 * why. A 403 is a restriction; this is a dead end.
 *
 * WHAT "HIDDEN ON DESKTOP" MEANS IN JSDOM. It is the `md:hidden` class, and
 * jsdom applies no media queries — so these assert the DECISION (is the class
 * applied?) rather than the pixels. That is the honest limit of this altitude,
 * and it is the right thing to pin: the class is the decision, and whether
 * Tailwind's breakpoint works is not this file's question. The browser gate
 * (`e2e/layout.spec.ts`) is where the rendered result is measured.
