/**
 * WS-M1 — the maintenance banner tenant users actually see.
 *
 * The window has been schedulable from the Platform Console for a while, but
 * nothing ever told a tenant user about it: the record existed and the read-only
 * mode blocked nothing. This is the half that makes "announced maintenance"
 * mean something.
 *
 * ── WHY IT SITS IN THE DOCUMENT FLOW, UNLIKE THE OTHER TWO BANNERS ──────────
 *
 * `AccessBanner` floats bottom-right and `ActionErrorBanner` floats under the
 * chrome, both because they interrupt someone mid-task over something they can
 * safely ignore. This is the opposite case. During a READ_ONLY window every
 * save in the application will fail, and a message the user can scroll past —
 * or that a table renders on top of — turns a planned, explained pause into
 * "the app is broken". So it takes real space at the very top, above the shell.
 *
 * ── WHY IT IS NOT DISMISSIBLE WHILE WRITES ARE BLOCKED ─────────────────────
 *
 * A dismissed banner is indistinguishable from no banner, and the user would
 * then hit a 423 on their next save with the explanation already thrown away.
 * An UPCOMING window is dismissible, because nothing is broken yet and the
 * point there is notice, not explanation.
 *
 * ── WHY IT RENDERS ABOVE THE LOGIN SCREEN TOO ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * Mounted inside BootGate rather than AppShell, so it appears on every route
 * including `/login`. During a fleet-wide window the people who most need the
 * message are the ones staring at a login screen wondering why nothing works —
 * gating it behind a session would hide it from exactly them. The endpoint it
 * reads is unauthenticated for the same reason.

 * error page, a half-deployed API.
 *
 * Trusting truthiness alone is not enough. An empty object is truthy, and it
 * renders as "undefined — scheduled in NaN" — which is worse than showing
 * nothing twice over. It is nonsense in front of every user, and because
 * `Callout` is a `role="status"` live region, a screen reader announces it.
 *
 * So: validate the fields this component actually reads, and render nothing
