/**
 * Floating action cluster (Pixie "Hub" floatbar) — a primary FAB, bottom-right,
 * that expands into round quick-action buttons: Praxis AI (opens the copilot),
 * Messages (Smart Comms), and Help. The primary button carries an unread badge.
 * The AI action only appears when the tenant's AI is enabled.
 *
 * TOUCH ONLY, as of Phase 5 (audit F9). The cluster is `md:hidden`; on desktop
 * the same list renders in `<IconRail>`'s tail.
 *
 * IT RENDERS ON EVERY TOUCH SCREEN, Smart Comms included. It used to be
 * suppressed there because it covered the composer's send control, with a
 * top-bar menu standing in; that menu is gone at every width, so suppressing it
 * here would leave a phone on `/comms` with no quick actions at all. It clears
 * the composer instead of hiding from it — see `--fab-floor` below.
 *
 * The audit's objection was not that a FAB is ugly. It is that this one sits at
 * `fixed bottom-24 right-5` — precisely where a list screen's last rows and its
 * pager are — and that being draggable was the workaround for that rather than a
 * feature. Worse, the dragged position PERSISTS: moving it out of the way on one
 * screen moved it into the way on every other one, permanently. On a phone the
 * trade is different and the pattern is right: the thumb is at the bottom right,
 * there is no chrome to spare, and there is nothing underneath at that moment
 * that a tap is competing with.
 *
 * Praxis AI opens the copilot via the `praxis:open-copilot` window event, so this
 * stays decoupled from the copilot component (which owns the panel). The action
 * list itself comes from `useQuickActions` so the two surfaces cannot drift.
 *
 * The cluster is draggable: press-and-drag the primary FAB to move it anywhere on
 * screen; the drop position is remembered (localStorage) across reloads. A small
 * move threshold distinguishes a drag from a click, so tapping still toggles the
 * menu. Anchored by the FAB's bottom edge so the actions still expand upward.
