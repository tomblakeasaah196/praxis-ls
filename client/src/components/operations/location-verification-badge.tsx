/**
 * The one-glance answer to "do we actually know where this is?"
 *
 * WHY A BADGE AT ALL. Until now a location on a file was a string, and a string
 * carries no confidence: "Douala" that came from the port catalogue and "Doula"
 * that a geocoder guessed at looked identical on screen, on the map and in the
 * Monday meeting. This is the smallest control that makes the difference visible,
 * and it appears everywhere a place does — the picker's trigger, the detail form,
 * the file header.
 *
 * The four states and their wording live in `place-meta.ts`, which is pure and
 * tested; this file is only the rendering. Tone never carries the meaning on its
 * own (WCAG §1.4.1) — each state ships its own word, and the title attribute
 * explains it in a sentence.
