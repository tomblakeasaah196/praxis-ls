/**
 * PlacePicker — how a location gets onto a file.
 *
 * ── THE PROBLEM IT REPLACES ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every origin and destination on this product used to be a text box with a
 * typeahead that also accepted whatever you typed. That is two failures wearing
 * one control. First, a typo saved cleanly: "Doula" is one letter from Cameroon's
 * main port, and the save path then forward-geocoded it in the background, got a
 * confident wrong answer, and linked the file to a coordinate nobody had looked
 * at. Second, there was nothing in the UI that distinguished a port somebody
 * chose from the catalogue from a string somebody typed — so the map, the
 * itinerary and the Monday meeting all treated them as equally true.
 *
 * ── THE SHAPE OF THE ANSWER, AND WHY IT IS THIS SHAPE ───────────────────────
 *
 * A verified-places rule has to have an answer for every real case or operators
 * will route around it. There are four, and they are deliberately NOT four
 * equally-weighted options on screen — that would be a wall of choices in front
 * of a task that is usually one keystroke and one click:
 *
 *   1. THE CATALOGUE. Type, pick. 322 seeded ports, airports and terminals, so
 *      this is the answer almost every time, and it costs nothing.
 *   2. WORLDWIDE SEARCH. One button, and it appears only when the catalogue came
 *      back thin. Opt-in because it spends provider quota and because the
 *      decision to search the whole world should be one a person made.
 *   3. A NEARBY REFERENCE POINT. Not a separate flow at all — a toggle on the
 *      confirmation step, because the operator has usually already found the
 *      junction near the customer and just needs to say "this is near, not at".
 *   4. ADD IT BY HAND. A dialog, last in the list, permission-gated.
 *
 * Each step down that ladder is one interaction deeper than the last, and nothing
 * below step 1 is on screen until step 1 has visibly failed. That is the whole
 * design: the common case stays a two-key operation, and the hard case is
 * reachable without anybody having to know it exists in advance.
 *
 * ── WHAT IT WILL NOT DO ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Commit free text. There is no "use what I typed" affordance, because that is
 * precisely the door this closes. An operator who cannot find their place gets
 * three escalating ways to create one instead — and the server enforces the same
 * rule (shipment_details.assertPlacesVerified), so the browser is the courtesy
 * and not the control.
 *
 * ── ACCESSIBILITY ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The WAI-ARIA 1.2 combobox-with-listbox pattern, as `SearchSelect` established
 * it here: `role="combobox"` with `aria-expanded`/`aria-controls`/
 * `aria-activedescendant`, a `role="listbox"` popup, Up/Down through results
 * (across BOTH groups, so keyboard users reach suggestions), Enter to commit,
 * Escape to close, and a polite live region announcing what arrived. Provider
 * text is rendered through React as text — never `innerHTML`, and no URL is ever
 * built from a provider field.
