/**
 * Dictionary Finder (MOD-05) — the one control for choosing a financial
 * dictionary line, used from costing, quotation, cash request, purchase order,
 * supplier invoice and the dictionary itself.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. The catalogue is 176 lines and nobody outside finance knows
 * what it calls things. An operations clerk looking at a carrier invoice sees
 * "surestaries"; the catalogue says Demurrage. A driver's paperwork says
 * "gasoil"; the catalogue says Fuel. A filed costing sheet says "#-1119"; that
 * code was retired at the migration. A native `<select>` over 176 options
 * answers none of those, so people pick the nearest-looking line and the
 * costing is wrong in a way nobody notices until the month-end.
 *
 * So the search is server-side and fuzzy (GET /financial-dictionary/search):
 * exact keyword hits first — the alternates, abbreviations, misspellings and
 * superseded codes seeded in 9081 — then code matches, then trigram similarity
 * over both labels and the description. Typing "demurage" with one r finds it.
 *
 * WHAT IT SHOWS, AND WHY. Each row carries the code, both labels, and the
 * direction as a badge. The direction is the part people get wrong: a DÉBOURS
 * line is money advanced for the client and re-billed at cost, a REVENUE line
 * is the company's own fee. Choosing between "Customs Clearance" (your fee) and
 * "Customs Duties & Taxes" (the client's money) is exactly the mistake this
 * badge is here to prevent, so it is on the row and not behind a tooltip.
 *
 * The description sits under the name because that is what disambiguates two
 * lines whose names look alike — and it is the field the fuzzy search matches
 * on, so the reason a row came back is visible.
 *
 * THE EQUIPMENT STEP. Some charges are priced per container type (0632's
 * `varies_by_equipment`), and until 0663 the document never recorded which box
 * it had bought. Rather than build that into each of the six forms that use
 * this control — six near-identical implementations, five of which would drift
 * — a caller opts in by passing `onPickMulti`, and picking a flagged charge
 * reveals the equipment step before returning. Callers that do not pass it are
 * untouched: same one-argument flow, same close-on-pick.
