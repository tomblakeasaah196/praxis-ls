/**
 * One conversation, as state — shared by the drawer and the workspace.
 *
 * WHY IT IS A HOOK AND NOT TWO COMPONENTS' WORTH OF `useState`. The drawer and
 * the full page are the same conversation seen through two windows: the middle
 * button in the drawer's header opens the page ON the thread you were just in.
 * If each surface owned its own send/confirm/restore logic, "expand" would be a
 * hand-off between two implementations that had already drifted — the copilot's
 * panel and the page would disagree about what a failed send looks like, or
 * whether a confirmed action collapses. There is one implementation, and the
 * two surfaces differ only in what they draw.
 *
 * THE TWO START MODES ARE THE ACTUAL PRODUCT DECISION HERE.
 *
 *   fresh    The drawer. Every open is a NEW thread. You opened it from a
 *            screen, about that screen; inheriting yesterday's conversation
 *            about receivables into a question about a delivery note is how the
 *            old floating panel made people distrust it. Past threads are not
 *            lost — they are on the full page, which is where browsing
 *            conversations belongs and where there is room to do it.
 *   restore  The workspace. Loads a specific thread (deep link) or the current
 *            rolling one, because a page you navigated to deliberately should
 *            be where you left off.
 *
 * PERSISTENCE IS THE BACKEND'S. The transcript lives in `ai_message`, so
 * nothing here tries to cache it — a reload re-reads it, and two devices see
 * one thread.
