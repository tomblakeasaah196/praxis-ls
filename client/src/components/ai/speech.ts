/**
 * Voice, both directions — dictating a question and hearing an answer.
 *
 * BOTH ARE THE BROWSER'S, NOT A MODEL'S. `speechSynthesis` and
 * `SpeechRecognition` ship in the platform, so this adds two genuinely useful
 * affordances without adding a vendor, a key, a budget line or a round trip.
 * That is the whole reason they are worth having at this stage: they are UI.
 *
 * WHY THEY MATTER ON THIS PRODUCT SPECIFICALLY. A logistics desk is not a desk
 * half the time. The person asking "what's blocking SBX-0142" is in a yard, at
 * a counter, or holding a phone in one hand and a delivery note in the other.
 * Dictation is faster than thumbs, and having a dispatch summary read out is the
 * difference between reading it now and reading it later.
 *
 * EVERYTHING DEGRADES TO NOTHING. `supported` is false on a browser without the
 * API — Firefox has no `SpeechRecognition` — and the callers render no button
 * at all rather than a dead one. A control that does nothing when pressed is
 * worse than an absent control, because the user spends a try finding out.
