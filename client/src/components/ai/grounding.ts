/**
 * Turning an answer into things the user can CLICK.
 *
 * An assistant that says "three invoices are overdue" and leaves you to go and
 * find them has moved the work, not done it. Everything here exists to close
 * that gap: pull the records an answer refers to out of its prose and offer
 * them as source chips, lift a result table out of the markdown and into a real
 * one, and notice when an answer is long enough that it belongs on a canvas
 * rather than in a chat bubble.
 *
 * WHERE THE CITATIONS COME FROM, AND WHY THERE ARE TWO SOURCES OF THEM.
 *
 * `/ai/ask` now returns structured `sources[]`, built server-side from the rows
 * the orchestrator's read actions actually returned
 * (`src/services/ai/answer-sources.js`). Those are the real citations: they say
 * what was READ, under a known permission, which no amount of reading the prose
 * can establish.
 *
 * `extractSources` remains, and remains the FLOOR rather than the mechanism. It
 * was written on the assumption that the model writes internal links —
 * `[INV-2026-0031](/finance/invoices/8f2c)` — because the screen registry it is
 * grounded on is a map of routes. It does not, and the system prompt tells it
 * not to ("NEVER show the user raw database identifiers"), which is why the
 * footer had never rendered. What it still catches is the case the backend
 * cannot: a route the model knew from the registry and linked deliberately, in
 * an answer that read nothing. `mergeSources` folds the two together with the
 * backend's winning on collision.
 *
 * Everything here is pure and string-in/data-out, so it is testable without a
 * render and cheap enough to run inside a `useMemo` on every turn.

 * The DOCUMENT inside an answer, with the conversation around it removed.

 * THE PROBLEM. An answer that drafts something arrives wrapped in chat:
 *
 *     Here's a draft memo for the finance department based on the financial model.
 *     ---
 *     INTERNAL MEMORANDUM
 *     …the actual memo…
 *     Prepared by: Tom Blake
 *     ---
 *     Would you like me to:
 *     1. Add a section on operating expenses…
 *     Just let me know.
 *
 * In the THREAD all of that is correct — it is a conversation, and the offer at
 * the end is the assistant doing its job. On the CANVAS it is noise: the canvas
 * holds the document you are going to send to the finance department, and
 * "Here's a draft memo" is not part of it.
 *
 * NON-LOSSY BY CONSTRUCTION, and that is the whole design. Each end is trimmed
 * only when it is confidently recognised; anything unrecognised is left exactly
 * as it was. The worst case is the behaviour we already had — the full text —
 * and the failure mode of a heuristic that guesses wrong is a slightly untidy
 * canvas, never a truncated document. The full answer also remains in the
 * thread regardless, so nothing is ever only-here.
 *
 * WHY A HEURISTIC AT ALL, given that guessing at model output is what left the
 * sources footer dead for weeks. Because the alternative — asking the model to
 * fence its documents — has to be paid for on four surfaces: the marker has to
 * be stripped from the thread, the copy button, the download and the read-aloud,
 * or it leaks as literal text. And it would STILL need this function as the
 * fallback for the turns where the model does not comply. Given that, the fence
 * buys precision on top of a trim that has to exist anyway; it is worth adding
 * when this proves unreliable in practice, not before.
