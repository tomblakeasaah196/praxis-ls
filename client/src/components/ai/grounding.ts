/**
 * Turning an answer into things the user can CLICK.
 *
 * An assistant that says "three invoices are overdue" and leaves you to go and
 * find them has moved the work, not done it. Everything here exists to close
 * that gap: pull the records an answer refers to out of its prose and offer
 * them as source chips, lift a result table out of the markdown and into a real
 * one, and notice when an answer is long enough that it belongs on a canvas
 * rather than in a chat bubble.
 *
 * WHY DERIVE RATHER THAN WAIT FOR THE BACKEND. `/ai/ask` returns prose plus
 * proposed actions and nothing else today (`lib/ai-api.ts`), so a grounding
 * footer that renders only from a `sources[]` field would be a footer that never
 * renders. The model already writes internal links — `[INV-2026-0031](/finance/
 * invoices/8f2c)` — because the screen registry it is grounded on is a map of
 * routes. So the links ARE the citations; they just were not being treated as
 * such. When the backend does start sending structured sources, `mergeSources`
 * folds them in and the derived ones stay as the floor.
 *
 * Everything here is pure and string-in/data-out, so it is testable without a
 * render and cheap enough to run inside a `useMemo` on every turn.
