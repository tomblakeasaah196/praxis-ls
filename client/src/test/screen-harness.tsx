/**
 * Screen harness — render a real routed screen in a test, with its data faked.
 *
 * WHY (Phase 4 validation: "Per-area a11y gate (axe, zero violations)").
 *
 * Everything the client tested before this was a PRIMITIVE. That is the right
 * place to start — `Field`'s label association fixes 565 call sites at once —
 * but it cannot see the defects that only exist once a screen is assembled: a
 * page with two `<h1>`s, a table whose action column has no accessible name, an
 * empty state that renders nothing at all, a loading branch that returns a bare
 * string. Those are exactly the per-screen checklist items in Phase 4, and none
 * of them are visible from a primitive's own test.
 *
 * It is also the only way to check the states honestly. A screen has four —
 * loading, error, empty, populated — and the audit found screens that had one
 * (F10: 28 ad-hoc "Loading…" strings; F11: 11 screens with no empty state at
 * all). Asserting "this screen renders" against a happy path would have passed
 * on every one of them.
 *
 * WHAT IT FAKES, and why that is enough. Screens reach the network through
 * exactly two places — `tenant()` / `tenantPaged()` in `lib/api-client`, and the
 * typed `lib/*-api` wrappers that themselves call `tenant()`. Faking the client
 * covers both, so a screen under test runs its REAL hooks, its REAL derivation
 * and filtering, and its REAL render tree. Nothing about the component is
 * stubbed; only the socket is.
 *
 * @example
 * vi.mock("@/lib/api-client", async () => apiClientMock());
 *
 * const { container } = renderScreen(<InvoicesPage />, {
 *   routes: { "/final-invoices": [{ invoice_id: "1", doc_number: "INV-1" }] },
 * });
 * expect(await axe(container)).toHaveNoViolations();
