 * a module in place when that module exports components and nothing else; a file
 * exporting both `ShellProvider` and `useShell` forces a full reload on every
 * edit, and the lint config reports it. The contexts and hooks therefore live in
 * `shell-context.ts` and `ribbon-commands.ts`, and the components live here.
 *
 * They share a file because they are one thing from the app's point of view —
 * what `app.tsx` and `app-shell.tsx` have to mount for the chrome to work — and
 * because two five-line files would be filing rather than structure.

 *
 * ── WHEN THIS RE-ASKS, AND WHY THOSE MOMENTS ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * On mount, on every navigation, and on window focus — throttled to one request
 * per `MIN_REVALIDATE_MS`.
 *
 * The alternatives were a poll and a socket. A poll spends a request per user
 * per interval forever to catch an event that happens a handful of times in a
 * tenant's year, and the codebase has already paid for that lesson once (PERF
 * S15, the badge timer in app-shell.tsx). A socket is exact and is the right
 * eventual answer, but it needs a server-side fan-out of `permission.changed`
 * to the affected users' sessions, which is a backend change this PR does not
 * make.
 *
 * Focus and navigation are the low-risk baseline because they bound the damage
 * by the thing that actually matters: a revoked user cannot do anything with a
 * stale ribbon without either clicking a destination (navigation → re-ask) or
 * coming back to the tab (focus → re-ask). And every request they DO make is
 * refused by the server regardless — this loop closes the UI, not the door.
