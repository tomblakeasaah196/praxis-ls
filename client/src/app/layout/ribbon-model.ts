/**
 * From "what may this user see" to "what does the ribbon draw".
 *
 * THE ONE RULE THIS FILE OBEYS. The grouping — which of the six workflow verbs
 * a module belongs to — is `platform.module_catalogue.group_key`, and it
 * arrives with every `GET /permissions/mine`. Nothing here decides it. What
 * this file owns is the join in the other direction: a verb's module keys are
 * turned into areas and sections by looking each route's module up in
 * `screen-registry.json`, which is the file a new route already has to be added
 * to. Verb labels and glyphs are below because a drawing is not a taxonomy.
 *
 * WHY AN AREA GETS EXACTLY ONE FAMILY. Several areas span verbs at the module
 * level — the Tax center is filed under MOD-07 (a `configure` module) but lives
 * in Finance, and Journals under MOD-05. Placing each SECTION under its own
 * module's verb would scatter one screen's tabs across two ribbon tabs, which
 * is worse than either alternative: you would open Finance and find two of its
 * ten sections missing, with no indication of where they went. So an area is
 * placed by the verb most of its visible modules agree on, and once placed it
 * shows every section this user can read.
 *
 * THE VOTE COUNTS DISTINCT MODULES, NOT SECTIONS, and that distinction decides
 * a real case. The Vault's overview, documents and signatures are all gated on
 * MOD-64 — one module, three screens — while verification, compliance flags and
 * reports are MOD-66, MOD-65 and MOD-63. Counting screens makes that 3–3, and
 * the tie hands the whole Vault to `monitor`, because MOD-64 is catalogued as
 * Smart Comms. Counting modules makes it 1–3 for `configure`, which is where a
 * document vault belongs. Screens are a UI decision about how to split a
 * module; modules are the authorisation surface, and that is the thing the
 * ribbon is partitioning.
