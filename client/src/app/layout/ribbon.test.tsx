/**
 * The ribbon and the icon rail, against the four things that would make them
 * wrong in ways nobody notices in review.
 *
 *   1. A FAMILY WITH NOTHING IN IT. The spec is "hidden entirely — not empty,
 *      not locked". An empty tab is worse than a missing one: it tells a user
 *      there is something there and then refuses to say what.
 *   2. A CEO WITH NO GRANT ROWS. `rbac.js` lets the CEO through every module
 *      regardless of the permission table, so a shell resolved from grants
 *      alone shows an empty ribbon over an app that permits everything. This is
 *      the failure a test that only exercises a normal user cannot see.
 *   3. THE TWO-TAB CASE. Access is per-role, so the ribbon has to be a resolved
 *      object at two tabs and at six. Layout is not testable in jsdom, but the
 *      accessibility of both is, and a scan at each count is what stops the
 *      "minimal" case being the one nobody ever renders.
 *   4. AN EMPTY RAIL. A customisable strip that arrives empty teaches nobody
 *      that it is customisable, and the `+` at the bottom reads as breakage
 *      rather than as an invitation.
 *
 * Everything here drives the REAL components through the real
 * `/permissions/mine` shape. The only thing faked is the network.
