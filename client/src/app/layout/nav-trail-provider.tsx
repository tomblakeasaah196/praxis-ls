/**
 * The navigation trail, wired to the router.
 *
 * This is the only thing that watches `useLocation()` and folds it into the
 * model in `nav-trail.ts`. Everything else — the arrows, the hold-menu, the
 * keyboard shortcuts, the screens that name their own entry — reads it through
 * `useNavTrail()` in `nav-trail-context.ts`.
 *
 * THE ARROWS NAVIGATE THE REAL STACK. `go()` calls `navigate(delta)`, so the
 * browser's own back button, the thumb buttons on a mouse, and a swipe gesture
 * on a trackpad all move the same cursor these arrows do. The trail is a
 * labelled shadow, never a second source of truth — see nav-trail.ts.

   * screen sets is the last word on its own entry.
   *
   * Keyed on `location.key` rather than on the url: the router mints a fresh
   * key for every history entry and restores the original one on a POP, so it
   * is the only identity that changes on a navigation to the URL you are
