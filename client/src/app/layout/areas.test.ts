/**
 * The hubs and the ribbon describe the same product.
 *
 * THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS TO CATCH is silent and slow: someone adds a tab to a
 * hub, the ribbon's second row is built from `areas.ts`, and the new screen is
 * simply not in the chrome. Nothing throws, nothing looks broken, and the tab
 * is reachable only by typing its URL — until somebody eventually reports that
 * a screen they were told about does not exist. Both lists come from one
 * definition now, and these tests are what keep it that way rather than
 * `hubTabs` being a convention people can route around.
 *
 * It also pins the JOIN to the permission model. The ribbon filters by module
 * key, and a section whose route is not in `screen-registry.json` has no module
 * key to filter on — so it would show for everybody regardless of grants. That
 * is a fail-open, and the registry is the one place the house rules already
 * require a new route to be listed.
