/**
 * The ribbon — two rows of chrome that replace the old area-nav strip and every
 * hub's in-page tab bar.
 *
 *   Row A   the workflow families, from `GET /permissions/mine`. Up to six.
 *   Row B   left, the destinations of the family you are in; right, the
 *           commands the current screen has published.
 *
 * WHAT THIS REPLACES, AND WHY IT IS FEWER ROWS AND NOT MORE. Before this, a
 * desktop user looking at an operations file passed three bands of navigation
 * before the first row of data: the title bar, an area menubar, and the hub's
 * own tab strip. The tab strip is now row B, so the count goes from three to
 * two, and the second one is doing the job the third used to.
 *
 * IT MUST LOOK RESOLVED AT ANY TAB COUNT. Access is per-role, so one user gets
 * six families and another gets two, and the two-tab case must not read as a
 * six-tab ribbon with four missing. That is why row A is a bounded TRACK —
 * a recessed group sized to its contents, like a segmented control — rather
 * than a row of links that runs out. Two segments in a track is a control; two
 * links in a 1600px row is a mistake. The pin toggle holds the right end at
 * every count, so the row is a pair of objects rather than a left-weighted
 * fringe.
 *
 * HEIGHT follows the density preference, exactly as `.wco` does — see `.ribbon`
 * in index.css. Two rows at the default level is 92px of chrome.
 *
 * NOT ON MOBILE. Below `md` this renders nothing: a horizontally scrolling
 * ribbon is the tell of a web page wearing an app's clothes. The phone gets the
 * bottom nav and a family sheet (`family-sheet.tsx`).
