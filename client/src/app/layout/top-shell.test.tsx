/**
 * The title bar strip — the two things about it that are invisible until they
 * are broken, and are then broken on a customer's desktop rather than in CI.
 *
 * 1. DRAG REGIONS. `.wco` sets `-webkit-app-region: drag` on the whole strip so
 *    the window can be moved by grabbing it, and every interactive descendant
 *    has to opt back out. Get that wrong in one direction and a button silently
 *    drags the window instead of doing its job; get it wrong in the other — no
 *    drag region at all — and the window cannot be moved by its title bar,
 *    which is worse, because there is no other way to move it.
 *
 *    That rule lives in CSS (`:is(button, a, input, …)`), which means jsdom
 *    cannot evaluate it: no stylesheet is loaded, so `getComputedStyle` reports
 *    nothing useful. So this test asserts the SHAPE the rule depends on —
 *    that every interactive element in the strip is a selector the rule
 *    matches — rather than the computed value. A control added as a `<div
 *    onClick>` would pass an interaction test and fail this one, correctly:
 *    it is exactly the element that would become undraggable and unclickable.
 *
 * 2. IT DEGRADES. WCO exists only in an installed desktop window. In a browser
 *    tab, and on every mobile browser, `env(titlebar-area-*)` is undefined and
 *    the strip must render as an ordinary bar with every control reachable.
 *    jsdom has no WCO either, so the default render IS the degraded case —
 *    which makes "everything is present and reachable here" the assertion.
