/**
 * Refresh — the third control in the rail's navigation pill, under back and
 * forward.
 *
 * WHY AN INSTALLED APP NEEDS ONE AT ALL. Same reason the arrows above it exist:
 * `display_override: ["window-controls-overlay"]` (src/routes/pwa.js) tells the
 * OS to stop drawing a title bar, and the strip it hands the page has no reload
 * button in it. A dispatcher running Praxis as an app has ⌘R and nothing else —
 * no pointer route to a refresh at all, on the surface where a stale figure
 * costs the most. That was the request, and it is the whole justification for
 * spending a fourth cell of the rail's fixed zone.
 *
 * TWO DIFFERENT VERBS, AND THE DISTINCTION IS THE DESIGN. What a person means
 * by "refresh" in an ERP is almost never "throw the application away and boot
 * it again":
 *
 *   TAP — refetch. Every active query is invalidated and refetched in place.
 *     No white flash, no boot, no lost scroll position, and — the one that
 *     actually matters — no lost form draft, because the page never unloads.
 *     This is the answer to "are these numbers current?", which is the question
 *     being asked ninety-nine times out of a hundred.
 *
 *   HOLD (or right-click) — the menu, which is where the destructive version
 *     lives: `Reload app` throws the tab away and boots, for the hundredth case
 *     where the app itself is wedged rather than the data being old. Putting it
 *     behind a deliberate gesture means the cheap action is the easy one and the
 *     expensive one still exists.
 *
 * The gesture is `use-hold-menu.ts` — the same one back and forward use, for
 * the same reason, so the three cells of this pill behave identically.
 *
 * THE MARK IS A DIAL, NOT A SPINNER. A refresh button that looks identical at
 * two seconds old and at forty minutes old answers "can I press this" and never
 * answers "do I need to". So the ring around the arrowhead is drawn from
 * `lib/data-freshness.ts`: full when the screen's data just landed, eroding
 * anticlockwise as the oldest thing on screen ages, down to a crescent at ten
 * minutes. The arrowhead never leaves, so the glyph still reads as "reload" at
 * every point on that scale — which is the constraint that ruled out the more
 * obvious designs (a ring that fills from empty spends most of its life not
 * looking like a refresh icon).
 *
 * IT DOES NOT CHANGE COLOUR AS IT DRAINS. An amber ring on an idle control says
 * "something is wrong", and nothing is: ten-minute-old data on a costing screen
 * is completely normal. The accent is spent on the two states that really are
 * asking for a decision — a staged build, and a refresh armed while offline.
 *
 * ARMED, NOT FAILED, WHEN OFFLINE. Pressing refresh on a dead connection used
 * to be a request that fails; here it arms instead. The ring goes dashed, and
 * `lib/connection.ts` fires it the moment our own API answers again. A user in
 * a lift presses it once rather than watching for the moment to press it.
