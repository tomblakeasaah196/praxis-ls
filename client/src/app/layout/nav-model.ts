/**
 * The grouped nav map — data, not markup.
 *
 * WHAT STILL READS THIS, now that the ribbon exists. Two surfaces that are
 * deliberately NOT permission-filtered chrome: the ⌘K command palette, and the
 * `< md` hamburger drawer. Both are complete indexes of the product's areas
 * rather than a view of one user's access, and both are grouped by AREA (the
 * sixteen headings below), not by the six workflow verbs the ribbon partitions
 * on. The ribbon's own map is `areas.ts` + `GET /permissions/mine`.
 *
 * The tiered `TOPBAR` table that used to live here went with the menubar it
 * described — the ribbon's second row reveals progressively by its own table
 * (`REVEAL` in ribbon.tsx), and a list nothing renders is a list nobody
 * maintains.
 *
 * Mirrors the target IA map (doc/FE_IA_HANDOFF.md).
