/**
 * Protected app shell.
 *
 * THREE BANDS OF CHROME, EACH DOING ONE JOB:
 *
 *   `.wco`      the title bar. In an installed window this IS the OS title bar
 *               (Window Controls Overlay); everywhere else it is the utility
 *               strip. Logo, search, environment, theme, alerts, account —
 *               with search and environment present at EVERY width (see the
 *               strip's own comment) and theme demoted into the account menu
 *               below `sm` to pay for them.
 *   `<Ribbon>`  navigation and screen commands — the workflow families this
 *               user can see, and the destinations inside the one they are in.
 *   `<IconRail>` a constant strip of shortcuts down the left edge.
 *
 * WHAT THE RIBBON REPLACED, and why this is fewer rows rather than more. The
 * nav row here used to be a menubar of sixteen areas, and every one of those
 * areas is a hub that drew its OWN tab strip inside the page. So a desktop user
 * opening an operations file crossed three bands of navigation before the first
 * row of data. The ribbon's second row IS the hub's tab strip — hoisted into
 * the chrome, drawn from the same definitions (`areas.ts`), and removed from
 * the page (`tabbed-hub.tsx` keeps it below `md`, where there is no ribbon).
 *
 * The ribbon is also PERMISSION-AWARE, which the menubar never was: it renders
 * from `GET /permissions/mine`, so a family whose modules this user cannot read
 * is not there at all — not greyed, not locked, not a 403 waiting to happen.
 *
 * BELOW `md` none of that applies: the bottom bar carries the same families and
 * opens each into a sheet (`mobile-nav.tsx`), and the hamburger drawer survives
 * for the full grouped index.

 *   3. `refetchOnWindowFocus` (on by default here) means coming back to the tab

 * everything else on the row. Every native desktop app solves this the same way
 * (WhatsApp, Slack, Teams, VS Code): a small square mark and the app's name in
 * plain text.
 *
 * It also makes the window self-consistent. The icon here is the SAME artwork
 * the operating system shows in the taskbar and on the home screen, and the
 * name is the one the install dialog used — both from Settings › App & PWA, so
 * a tenant configures their installed identity once and the title bar follows.
 * It is the same component the editor's title-bar preview draws with, so that
 * preview now predicts the real bar instead of merely resembling it.

  // header, update state; the `key={env}` on <main> remounts the routed screen
  // so every useEffect re-fetches under the new environment. Access token, auth
  // and scroll of the shell are preserved.
  //
  // WHY THE STEPS ARE ORDERED THE WAY THEY ARE — this is the fix for the stale-
  // toggle bug (a user switching LIVE → TEST briefly saw LIVE data until they
  // refreshed the browser). The bug had three sources; each step here addresses
  // one:
  //
  //   1. `tenantKey()` and `resourceKey()` include env now, so a switch produces
  //      a fresh cache key and TanStack can never serve the other env's data
  //      from cache. This is the primary fix — the rest is defence.
  //
  //   2. `qc.cancelQueries()` stops any in-flight LIVE fetch. Without this, a
  //      request that departed before the switch would land after it, and its
  //      response (correctly headed with X-Praxis-Env: live) would still
  //      populate the LIVE-keyed cache — which is fine per se, but wastes a
  //      round-trip on data the user is no longer looking at.
  //
  //   3. The comms websocket carries env in its handshake, not per message —
  //      so a live socket keeps subscribing to the OLD env's channels until it
  //      is torn down. Disconnect here; the next `getCommsSocket()` reconnects
  //      under the new env.
  //
  // The overlay is a brief interstitial (~350 ms, or however long the first
  // batch of new-env fetches takes) so the switch is felt, not a silent
  // repaint. `key={env}` on <main> still remounts the routed screen — that
  // is what actually causes every screen's `useQuery` to be called again, with
  // the new key.

        ── THE TITLE BAR ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
        In an installed window this IS the title bar: `display_override:
        ["window-controls-overlay"]` (src/routes/pwa.js) tells the OS to stop
        drawing one and hand the strip to the page, and `.wco` insets this row
        past the caption buttons using env(titlebar-area-*) — which is what
        makes it correct with the controls on the right (Windows) or the left
        (macOS) without a line of platform code.

        Everywhere else — a browser tab, and every mobile browser, none of which
        implement WCO — the env() fallbacks resolve to zero and this is simply
        the app's utility bar. One component, one code path.

        WHAT MOVED HERE, and why it is worth doing. Search, the environment
        toggle, notifications and the account menu used to sit in the 66px nav
        row below. An installed window was therefore spending a whole band of
        chrome on a title it already knew, while the row that carries the
        product's actual navigation fought for width. Moving the utility cluster
        into space the OS was wasting gives the nav row back its full width and
        is the entire point of adopting WCO.

        The strip drags the window (see `.wco` in index.css); every interactive
        child opts out via the `:is(button, a, input…)` rule there, which
        top-shell.test.tsx pins.
