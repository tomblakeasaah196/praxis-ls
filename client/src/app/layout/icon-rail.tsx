/**
 * The icon rail — a fixed strip of shortcuts down the left edge.
 *
 * ICONS ONLY, AND IT NEVER WIDENS. The obvious pattern here is a rail that
 * expands to show labels on hover. It is the wrong one for this product: the
 * content beside it is tables, and a rail that widens reflows every column in
 * one while the pointer merely crosses the edge of the window on its way
 * somewhere else. Labels come from a tooltip, which costs nothing and moves
 * nothing.
 *
 * IT IS NOT A SECOND RIBBON. The contents do not change with the ribbon's
 * active family — see `rail-model.ts`. Control Tower and search are fixed, the
 * middle is whatever this user pinned, and the tail is the quick actions the
 * desktop menu and the touch cluster already share (`quick-actions.tsx`), so
 * there is one list of those rather than a third.
 *
 * THE `+` AT THE BOTTOM, AND ITS ONE JIGGLE. A customisable rail that nobody
 * knows is customisable is not customisable. A single short shake on a user's
 * first session teaches it; anything more is a tic. It fires once, is recorded
 * server-side (`railHintSeen`) so it does not repeat on another device, and is
 * suppressed entirely under `prefers-reduced-motion` — index.css kills the
 * animation globally too, but a hint that silently does nothing should not also
 * spend the one time it was allowed to fire.
