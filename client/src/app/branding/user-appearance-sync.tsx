/**
 * Applies the signed-in user's personal typography, once, on sign-in.
 *
 * WHY A SEPARATE COMPONENT. BrandingProvider sits OUTSIDE AuthProvider on
 * purpose — the login screen has to be branded before anyone has a token, so
 * the provider cannot depend on auth. But `/me/preferences/appearance` needs
 * one. This component lives inside AuthProvider, where both contexts are
 * readable, and pushes the result up into the branding layer. It renders
 * nothing.
 *
 * WHY THE PERSONAL LAYER IS NOT APPLIED PRE-LOGIN. It cannot be: the server
 * will not say who you are without a token. So the login screen is always the
 * tenant's type, and the user's own takes over on the first authenticated
 * paint. Fonts swapping once at sign-in is the honest behaviour here — the
 * alternative is caching a user's fonts in localStorage and painting them
 * before we know who is at the keyboard, which is wrong on a shared terminal.
