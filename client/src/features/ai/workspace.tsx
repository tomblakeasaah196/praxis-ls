/**
 * Praxis AI — the full workspace at `/ai`.
 *
 * THE SHAPE: three panes, the outer two collapsible.
 *
 *   left    Spaces + conversation history (`history-rail.tsx`).
 *   centre  The thread, on a reading-width column, with the composer under it.
 *   right   Canvas / Table / Record / Sources (`right-pane.tsx`).
 *
 * WHY THREE AND NOT TWO. An ERP answer is rarely just prose. "What's overdue"
 * has rows behind it; "draft the reminder" has a document behind it; every
 * figure has a record behind it. A two-pane assistant has to choose between
 * showing you those inline — where a twenty-row table is unreadable and
 * unsortable — or making you leave the conversation to see them. The third pane
 * is what lets an answer keep its prose in the thread and put its OUTPUT
 * somewhere it can be worked with.
 *
 * IT KEEPS THE SHELL AND DROPS THE PAGE HEADER — the only screen that does.
 *
 * The ribbon and the icon rail stay, because the alternative — hiding the
 * chrome for a distraction-free canvas — would make the assistant feel like a
 * separate product bolted to the side of the ERP, when the entire proposition
 * is that it is inside it and acting as you.
 *
 * But `PageHeader` goes. Every other screen earns one: it names what you are
 * about to read before you read it. This screen is not something you read, it
 * is a room you work in, and the header was spending the top eighth of that
 * room restating the ribbon tab immediately above it. The full height goes to
 * the thread instead, and the permissions assurance it used to carry now sits
 * under the composer, where the person about to ask a question can see it.
 *
 * That exception should stay singular. A product where every screen argues for
 * its own chrome has no chrome; the argument here is that this is the only
 * route whose content is a conversation rather than a record.
 *
 * ITS RELATIONSHIP TO THE DRAWER. Same thread state (`useAiThread`), same
 * composer, same turn rendering. The drawer's middle button lands here with
 * `?c=<conversation_id>`, so "this needs more room" is one click and loses
 * nothing. The one deliberate divergence: the drawer starts fresh every open,
 * this restores — a panel you flicked open over a screen and a page you
 * navigated to on purpose are different intentions.

   * THE PANE FILLS ITSELF. This is the behaviour that was missing.
   *
   * Before this, an answer's tables and drafts sat inert until you found the
   * small canvas icon in a hover toolbar and clicked it — which meant that in
   * practice nobody ever saw the right pane do anything, and it read as three
   * empty tabs and a broken feature. An answer that produced a seven-table
   * financial model showed you an empty panel until you went looking.
   *
   * So: every new assistant turn populates the pane and opens it, on the richest
   * thing it produced — tables first, then the document. Nothing to click.
   *
   * IT TRACKS THE LATEST ANSWER, not a pinned one. The pane is a view of the
   * conversation's current state, so a new answer replaces it; the toolbar on an
   * older turn is how you deliberately go back to that one (`openOutput`).
   *
   * WHY IT DOES NOT FIGHT YOU. Two separate questions, deliberately kept apart:
   * WHAT the pane shows follows the latest answer continuously, so a table that
   * is still arriving keeps filling in; WHETHER the pane opens fires once per
   * answer. Close it mid-stream and it stays closed until the NEXT answer, with
   * its content quietly kept current behind it. Tying both to the turn id — the

   * from that turn. Every token that followed — including the seven tables —

      The assurance line it carried is not lost; it was always in two places at
      once. It lives under the composer, where somebody about to type a question
      about live financial data can actually see it, rather than above a
      transcript they have already scrolled past.

      Deliberately THE exception, and it should stay the only one. A product

          is right for every screen that is a document on a page. This one is not
          a document on a page; it is the page. Sat inside that padding, and

          negative margins cancel the padding so the rails reach the window edge,
          and the height is grown by the same amount so the bottom does not fall
          short of it.

          The exception lives HERE rather than in the shell, deliberately: the

          numbers mirror `app-shell.tsx`'s padding and would need changing with
          it — which is why they are spelled out rather than hidden in a utility.

          NOT below `md`. There the padding includes `pb-24`, which is clearance
          for the mobile bottom nav — bleeding into it would put the composer
          underneath the navigation bar.

/**
 * The landing state — greeting, composer, suggestion deck.
 *
 * VERTICALLY CENTRED, not top-aligned. An empty thread top-aligned leaves a
 * screen of dead space under it and reads as a page that failed to load; centred
 * it reads as an invitation. It re-anchors to the top the moment there is a
 * turn, which is where a transcript belongs.
 *
 * THE DECK STATES QUESTIONS, NOT FIGURES. A card reading "3 invoices overdue"
 * needs a briefing endpoint behind it, and inventing the 3 would be a lie
 * printed on the first screen of an accounting product. The cards ask the
 * question instead — the count arrives with the answer, from the ledger. The
 * `badge` slot is where a real figure goes when there is a real endpoint for it.
