/**
 * The workspace's left rail — Spaces above, conversations below.
 *
 * SPACES ARE SCOPES YOU HAVE PARKED IN. They are not a second taxonomy: the list
 * is `useAiScopes()`, the same permission-aware list the composer's scope chip
 * renders (`components/ai/context.tsx`). Picking Finance here does exactly what
 * picking Finance there does — it points the next question at Finance. Building
 * them as two concepts is how you end up with a product where "Finance" means
 * one thing in a dropdown and another in a sidebar.
 *
 * AND THE SPACES SECTION COLLAPSES (audit J4). It was fixed and always open, so
 * on a tenant with the full module set the scope list pushed the conversation
 * list below the fold and the rail's main job — finding a thread — happened in
 * whatever height was left over. The state is remembered PER USER, keyed by
 * user id: a shared workstation is two people with two different rails, and
 * a plain localStorage key would hand the second one the first one's layout.
 *
 * HISTORY IS GROUPED BY WHEN, NOT DATED. Nobody remembers they asked about the
 * Douala file on the 14th; they remember it was "the other day". Buckets
 * (`groupConversations`) match how the memory actually works, and empty ones are
 * dropped so the rail never shows a heading with nothing under it. Pinned
 * threads sit in their own group above those buckets — a pin whose thread still
 * slides from "Today" into "Previous 7 days" has not pinned anything.
 *
 * THE SEARCH FIELD FILTERS WHAT IS LOADED, and does not query the server. The
 * conversation list is metadata for one user — titles and timestamps — so it
 * arrives in one read and filtering it locally is instant. A search that goes to
 * the network to filter a list already in memory is a slower version of the same
 * answer.
 *
 * ROW AFFORDANCES (audit J5). Each row carries an overflow menu — pin, rename,
 * archive, delete. Two things about its shape are deliberate:
 *
 *   The row is a DIV CONTAINING TWO BUTTONS, not one button with a menu inside
 *   it. A button nested in a button is invalid, and the browsers that tolerate
 *   it deliver the click to whichever they feel like. The open control and the
 *   menu trigger are siblings; the div is layout and carries no handler, so
 *   nothing here needs an a11y suppression.
 *
 *   The trigger is TRANSPARENT UNTIL HOVER OR FOCUS, never absent. Rendering it
 *   only on hover would mean it does not exist for a keyboard or a screen
 *   reader; `group-focus-within` brings it back the instant it is tabbed to, so
 *   the quiet rail and the reachable control are the same markup.
 *
 * DELETE IS TWO-TIERED AND THE SECOND TIER IS OPT-IN. Deleting hides the thread
 * and stops it being loadable; the checkbox in the confirm also destroys the
 * transcript. That distinction exists because the audit's J1 case is somebody
 * who needs a sensitive conversation GONE, and a soft flag does not honour that
 * — but the hard half is irreversible, so it is a decision the person makes in
 * the dialog rather than a consequence of pressing Delete.
 *
 * NO NATIVE DIALOGS. `useConfirm` and `usePrompt` — see CLAUDE.md. A
 * `window.prompt` for the rename would have rendered "app.praxis-ls.com says"
 * over a white-labelled product, and `confirm` blocks the event loop, which on
 * this screen means blocking a stream that is mid-answer.
 *
 * This rail is the reason the drawer does not need history. Browsing past
 * conversations wants width, grouping and a search field; a 440px panel opened
 * over a screen you were reading wants none of those, and giving it them was
 * what made the old copilot's history sidebar cover its own transcript.
