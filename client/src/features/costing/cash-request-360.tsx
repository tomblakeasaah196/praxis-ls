/**
 * The cash-request worksheet — a page on desktop, a sheet on a phone.
 *
 * ── WHY IT IS A ROUTE, AND WHY IT MIRRORS THE COSTING ──────────────────────
 *
 * The cash request was a `<Modal size="lg">` that could only be created, never
 * edited: the form posted and closed, and `PATCH /cash-requests/:id` — a route
 * the API has always exposed — had no caller at all. The same three arguments
 * that moved the costing onto its own route apply here: a document carrying a
 * file strip, a nine-column grid, a payments table and a workflow rail does not
 * fit in a dialog; a request awaiting approval has to be SENDABLE, which needs
 * an address; and the body must render from the RESPONSE, because a request
 * opened from a pasted link has a uuid and nothing else (FRONTEND_GUIDE §3.11).
 *
 * ── THE THING THIS SCREEN EXISTS TO SHOW ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A costing is the operations file's fulfilment budget, and this document draws
 * it down. So the grid is not a list of amounts — every row carries what the
 * budget authorised, what is already claimed against it, what this request
 * wants, and what would be left. Pick the file and the lines arrive already
 * defaulted to what remains; untick what this request is not for.
 *
 * Nothing here decides what is ALLOWED. The server re-derives every gate
 * (`assertFundable`) and a 422 is always the last word; this decides what to
 * offer, and explains a refusal before the person meets it.
