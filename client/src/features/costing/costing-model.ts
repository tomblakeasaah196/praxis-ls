/**
 * The costing worksheet's model layer — no JSX, no React.
 *
 * These are the pure pieces the sheet, the line grid, the Suggest dialog and
 * the register all need: what a line looks like while it is being edited, how
 * a line is identified, how a sheet's money adds up, and how a status enum is
 * said out loud.
 *
 * They live in their own module for two reasons.
 *
 * 1. THE TWO KEYS MUST AGREE. `lineKey` (a line already on the sheet) and
 *    `suggestionKey` (a line being offered) are the same notion of identity —
 *    dictionary item plus container type, because a charge priced per box is
 *    several lines that share an item and differ only by equipment. If they
 *    ever drift, Suggest re-offers a charge that is already on the sheet and
 *    the importer silently duplicates it. Side by side, that drift is visible.
 *
 * 2. The register imports `statusLabel` and `COSTING_BASE`. Taking them from
 *    the sheet dragged the whole worksheet — grid, dialogs, Suggest — into the
 *    register's chunk, and tripped `react-refresh/only-export-components` on
 *    every module that mixed a component with a helper.
