/**
 * Budget Reconciliation — what the sheet must not lose.
 *
 * WHAT THESE PIN, and why each is a defect waiting to happen.
 *
 * 1. THE PRE-FILL IS A HYPOTHESIS, NOT AN ANSWER. An untouched line shows what
 *    was disbursed — "we gave you 119 250, is that what you spent?" — and the
 *    sheet says so. A regression that rendered it as a confirmed actual would be
 *    invisible: the number is right, the claim about it is not.
 *
 * 2. THE FOOTER MOVES AS YOU TYPE. The legacy's `calculateTotals()` re-footed on
 *    every keystroke and it is the one thing about that screen worth copying. A
 *    footer that waits for the server reads as a frozen page.
 *
 * 3. A LINE CANNOT BE INVENTED HERE. Owner decision Q11: no spend on an
 *    operations file without an approved costing. The sheet has to say where the
 *    fix is, not offer an "add line" button.
 *
 * 4. THE + IS THE PROOF AFFORDANCE. A line that owes a receipt and has none
 *    shows it; one that has two shows the count. Losing that is losing the whole
 *    of the owner's "we probably just get a + for each line".
 *
 * 5. NO APPROVED COSTING IS A SENTENCE, NOT AN EMPTY TABLE.
