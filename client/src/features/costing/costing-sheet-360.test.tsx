/**
 * The costing worksheet — what it must not lose.
 *
 * WHAT THESE PIN, and why each is a defect waiting to happen.
 *
 * 1. THE SHEET NAMES ITSELF FROM THE RESPONSE ALONE. It is a route, so a sheet
 *    reached from a pasted link has a uuid and nothing else. If `GET
 *    /costings/:id` ever stops carrying `file`, the regression is silent — a
 *    header reading "CST-2026-0043 · undefined" still renders.
 *
 * 2. NATURE AND VAT COME FROM THE CATALOGUE. The legacy sheet asked the user to
 *    tick a VAT box that defaulted to ticked, which is why its sample sheet
 *    charges 19.25% VAT on a customs duty. A pass-through line must offer no VAT
 *    control at all, and must say why.
 *
 * 3. DÉBOURS VAT IS BUDGETED, AND MARKED (PT) (12768). The débours net is in HT
 *    and the supplier's VAT is in the VAT total and TTC — a costing is a cash
 *    budget. The (PT) tag and a rate control are what a reader sees on the line.
 *
 * 4. SUGGEST TOPS UP. A charge already on the sheet is offered as already
 *    present, never re-added — because re-adding it would silently duplicate a
 *    line somebody had already priced by hand.
 *
 * 5. THE REGISTER'S MONEY AND COUNTS ARE THE SERVER'S. Its Total column read two
 *    fields that were never columns, and its KPI strip counted the loaded page.
