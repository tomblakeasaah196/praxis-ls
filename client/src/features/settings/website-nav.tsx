/**
 * The website area's own sub-navigation.
 *
 * ── WHY A LINK ROW AND NOT A `<Tabs>` ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `components/ui/tabs.tsx` says it plainly in its own header: tabs are sibling
 * views of ONE subject, and "if each tab is really a different screen with its
 * own URL, use routes". Pages and articles are different screens over different
 * tables with different permissions to come; a Radix tablist here would put
 * two routes behind one tab stop and break the back button for whichever one
 * lost. So these are links that look like a strip, with `aria-current` doing
 * the work `aria-selected` would have done.
 *
 * It exists at all because the Settings ribbon deliberately holds only the
 * handful of editors an administrator opens repeatedly (see `layout/areas.ts`),
 * and the website screens are not among them. Without a strip here, somebody
 * editing the home page had no way to reach the articles except by going back
 * to the settings card grid and hunting for a second card.
