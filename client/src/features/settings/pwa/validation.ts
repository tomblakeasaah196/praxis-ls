/**
 * Installability and legibility checks for the App & PWA editor.
 *
 * THESE WARN; THEY DO NOT BLOCK. Deliberate, and worth stating because the
 * opposite is the tempting default. The API never ships a broken manifest — an
 * unreadable icon falls back to a brand monogram, a missing name to the tenant
 * slug — so nothing here can make the app uninstallable. What these catch is the
 * gap between "valid" and "good": an icon that is technically fine and loses its
 * descender to a circular crop, a splash whose progress bar is invisible against
 * its own background. That is a judgement about a brand, and the tenant owns
 * their brand. Some marks genuinely are designed to bleed past the safe zone.
 *
 * So each check states the consequence in terms of what the user will SEE on a
 * device, and the editor draws the same fact next to it (the safe-zone circle,
 * the three launcher masks). A warning nobody can act on is noise; a warning
 * next to a picture of the problem is a decision.

 * every tenant, on first open. A warning that is on by default is not a warning;
 * it is a permanent piece of furniture that teaches people to ignore the panel
 * it lives in.
 *
 * Against the square it fires on what it is actually for: artwork zoomed or

 * literal corners get shaved on a circular crop — is the one thing the tenant
