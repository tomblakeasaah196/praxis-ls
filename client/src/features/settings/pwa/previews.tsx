 * `@shared/pwa-design` — the same function `src/routes/pwa.js` uses to position
 * the artwork when sharp composites the real PNG. The CSS equivalent of
 * `fit: "contain"` into a square box is `object-fit: contain` on a square
 * element, so the two renders agree by construction rather than by someone
 * keeping two sets of arithmetic in sync. If that ever stops being true, the
 * preview stops being evidence and becomes decoration.
 *
 * `AppIcon` itself now lives in `components/ui/app-icon` because the window
 * title bar renders the same mark; it is re-exported here so this module stays
 * the one import for everything the editor draws. See that file for the masks
 * and the safe zone.
