/**
 * The Control Tower's shortcut grid, edited — the eleven modules a user
 * pins to the home screen's Applications block.
 *
 * WHY IT LIVES ON MY APPEARANCE, next to the rail picker: both are personal
 * display preferences persisted through `/me/preferences/shell`, both are
 * self-service (no permission required to change your own), and both are
 * about arranging the chrome — one pinned to the left edge, one pinned to
 * the home screen. Splitting them across two settings pages would mean two
 * places to teach a user "you can customise this" and would suggest they are
 * two different concepts. They are the same concept applied to two surfaces.
 *
 * ONLY WHAT THIS USER CAN REACH is offered — the candidate list is
 * `pinnableTowerAreas`, which is the ribbon's areas minus the Control Tower
 * itself and Support & feedback. A pin whose grant is later revoked
 * disappears from the launcher on its own (`resolveTowerPins`), same as the
 * rail.
