/**
 * Settings › Website › the asset library — guide §6.3, carried out of PR 2, PR
 * 3 and PR 4 and built here because §9.3 and §9.4 are dead without it.
 *
 * ── IT IS A CONTROL, NOT A PAGE, AND THAT IS THE READING OF §6.3 ──────────
 *
 * §6.3 names this FILE. It does not name a screen, and a separate "assets"
 * screen would be the wrong shape: every image this product stores belongs to a
 * row somebody is already editing — this partner's mark, this person's
 * portrait, this entity's cover. A library page would mean uploading a file in
 * one place and then going somewhere else to say what it was of, which is how a
 * tenant ends up with four unattached logos and no idea which is current.
 *
 * So the control lives here, once, and the three screens that own rows mount it
 * inline. The reason that is worth stating is that it makes the §1.3 rule
 * unavoidable: there is one component, it always knows its slot, and a slot
 * always knows whether it is an evidence slot.
 *
 * ── THE CONSTRAINTS ARE SHOWN BEFORE THE FILE DIALOG OPENS ────────────────
 *
 * §6.3, in its own words: "A tenant who learns the constraint after a rejected
 * upload uploads something wrong twice." The aspect, the minimum width and the
 * byte cap are printed next to the control, and they are read from
 * `@praxis/shared`'s `SITE_MEDIA_SLOTS` — the same object the API validates
 * against — so the hint cannot promise something the server refuses.
 *
 * ── PROVENANCE IS REQUIRED, AND `generated` IS NOT OFFERED HERE ───────────
 *
 * §6.3 asks that the server refuse a generated asset for a restricted slot and
 * that "the UI disables those slots rather than failing after the fact". Every
 * slot in the register today IS restricted, so the honest version of that is
 * not a disabled option with a tooltip — it is an option that is absent, with
 * the rule written where the choice is made. The server refuses it anyway
 * (`site_settings.media.js`), and 13789 refuses it again at the row. Three
 * layers, the same shape the permission note already has.
 *
 * ── WHY THERE IS NO ALT-TEXT FIELD ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * §6.3 asks for a bilingual `alt` on every non-decorative asset. Every slot
 * here is a picture OF a thing the tenant has already named on the same form: a
 * portrait is of the leader whose name is in the field above it, a mark is of
 * the partner named beside it, a cover is of the entity. So the alt text is
 * that name, and the renderer composes the sentence around it from its own
 * dictionary in the visitor's language.
 *
 * A second copy of the name, typed twice, would be a copy that drifts the day
 * somebody corrects a spelling — and it would be the copy a screen-reader user
 * hears. Recorded as a deviation in the guide's §3.6.
