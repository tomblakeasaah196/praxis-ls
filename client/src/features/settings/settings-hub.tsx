/**
 * Settings hub — the "configure the hub" card grid (pixie reference). Sections
 * of cards; each card routes to its editor. Screens that aren't built yet route
 * to the shared ComingSoon placeholder (see doc/FE_IA_HANDOFF.md). Cards linking
 * into existing areas (Appearance, Notifications, IAM, Roles) go straight there.
 *
 * THE GRID IS FILTERED BY GRANT. This is the densest single collection of
 * destinations in the product — twenty-four cards spanning IAM, the module
 * catalogue, payment gateways and the portal — and it was hard-coded, so any
 * user who could reach /settings at all was offered every one of them. The
 * cards go through the same `canOpenRoute` as the ribbon and the palette, and a
 * section whose cards are all filtered out is dropped rather than left as a
 * heading over nothing (the same rule `buildRibbon` applies to an empty family).
 *
 * A user who can open none of them still gets the page, with its `<h1>` and a
 * line saying so — a settings screen that renders as a bare title reads as a
 * failure, and this is a refusal.
