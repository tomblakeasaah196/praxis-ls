/**
 * The icon rail's shortcuts, edited — the destination of the `+` at the bottom
 * of the rail.
 *
 * WHY IT LIVES ON MY APPEARANCE. This is a personal display preference, in the
 * same family as the fonts on this page: it changes what one person sees and
 * nobody else, and it persists through the same `/me/preferences` endpoints
 * that are scoped to the caller by construction. Settings › Appearance is the
 * TENANT's editor, behind the Settings-edit grant — putting a personal
 * shortcut list there would mean needing permission to rewrite the company's
 * brand in order to pin Fleet to your own rail.
 *
 * ONLY WHAT THIS USER CAN REACH is offered. The candidate list is the areas the
 * ribbon resolved for them, so nobody can pin a destination they would be
 * refused at — and a pin whose grant is later revoked disappears from the rail
 * on its own (`resolveRailPins`).
