/**
 * The map's key: what each colour and each marker means.
 *
 * WHY A LEGEND IS NOT DECORATION HERE. The map carries meaning in colour (mode),
 * in marker shape (kind of place), and in marker fill (whether the coordinate is
 * exact or a reference point near it). None of that is guessable, and one of them
 * — the hollow reference-point marker — is a claim about how much we know, which
 * is precisely the kind of thing a reader must not have to infer. WCAG §1.4.1 is
 * the floor: every distinction below is also carried by a word.
 *
 * It stays visible in full-screen and meeting mode, because those are the two
 * places where somebody who has never used the screen is reading it over a
 * shoulder.
