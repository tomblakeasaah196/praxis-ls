/**
 * The work that is not a route — and the routes we cannot draw yet.
 *
 * WHY THIS PANEL EXISTS AT ALL. The Control Tower was a map, so the only files it
 * could represent were files with two coordinates. Three of this product's twelve
 * service types move nothing: Warehousing is custody at a place, Customs
 * Brokerage is a clearance, Business Representation is a mandate over a period.
 * They have deadlines, exceptions and clients like everything else, and the old
 * tower did one of two wrong things with them — dropped them off the screen, or
 * drew a lane between two places one of them happened to mention.
 *
 * THE SECOND HALF IS THE MORE IMPORTANT ONE. A file whose origin or destination is
 * named but NOT verified cannot honestly be plotted: the coordinate is either
 * absent or is a background geocode nobody confirmed. The previous behaviour was
 * to draw it anyway. Now it appears here, with what is wrong and a way to fix it —
 * which turns a silent wrong pin into a short, actionable list.
 *
 * EXCEPTION-FIRST ORDER. Files needing a location come before ordinary activity,
 * because one is a thing to fix and the other is a thing to note.
