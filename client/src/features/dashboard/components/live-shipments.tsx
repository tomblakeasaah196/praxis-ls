/**
 * Live shipments panel — the open dossiers, newest ETA first.
 *
 * Each row is a link to Operations filtered to that dossier's ref. In the iframe
 * these were `<div>`s that the injection script retro-fitted with `role="link"`
 * and a keydown handler, then routed through a `postMessage` bridge because the
 * frame could not navigate the app itself. A `<Link>` does all of that by being
 * a link.
 *
 * The progress bar is milestone completion from the milestone engine. It is
 * ABSENT, not zero, for a dossier with no template instantiated: "not tracked"
 * and "not started" are different facts and a 0%-width bar asserts the wrong one.
