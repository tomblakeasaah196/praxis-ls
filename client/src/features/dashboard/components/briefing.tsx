/**
 * Praxis briefing — the standing "what needs you" line.
 *
 * The mock's version was a paragraph of fiction naming real-looking dossiers and
 * invoices ("SLAS-INV-2026-0311 is 34 days overdue, Sonara"). The iframe build
 * replaced the text with live counts but kept it as an HTML string assembled
 * with `<b>` tags and injected through `innerHTML`.
 *
 * It is now a list of facts, each one a LINK to the screen that resolves it —
 * which is the only thing a briefing is for. A count with nowhere to go is a
 * decoration. Facts that are zero are omitted rather than rendered as "0
 * awaiting approval": a briefing lists what needs doing, not what does not.
