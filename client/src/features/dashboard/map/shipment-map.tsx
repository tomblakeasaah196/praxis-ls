/**
 * Live shipment map — real geography, plotted from real dossiers, one segment per
 * itinerary leg.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED, AND WHY IT MATTERS MORE THAN IT LOOKS. This drew one line per FILE,
 * from POL to POD. That is the main carriage and nothing else — so an end-to-end
 * file (collect from the shipper, sail, clear customs, truck inland, deliver to
 * the door) showed one of its five movements, and the four an operator is actually
 * chased about were invisible. The same file now draws five segments in three
 * colours, and selection ties them back together.
 *
 * IT IS ALSO INTERACTIVE NOW, and that is the difference between a picture of the
 * work and a tool for running a meeting: hover or focus a route for the file, the
 * leg, the route, the milestone and the date; click to select it, which zooms to
 * it, dims the rest and opens the itinerary; Escape to come back.
 *
 * EVERY INTERACTION HAS A KEYBOARD ROUTE. The routes are a single composite
 * widget — one tab stop, arrows to move between files, Enter or Space to select —
 * rather than one tab stop per lane, because a hundred-file map would otherwise be
 * three hundred presses wide and the keyboard would stop being a way to get
 * anywhere. Hover is never the only path to information (WCAG §1.4.13): the card
 * renders on focus too, and everything in it is in the panel a click opens.
 *
 * COLOUR AND SHAPE. Sea is green, air is blue, road is orange, from three declared
 * `--mode-*` tokens rather than borrowed brand colours — see `LANE_STROKE`. The
 * marker travelling each lane is that mode's own glyph (a ship, a plane, a truck)
 * turned along the path, and each endpoint is shaped by what kind of place it is,
 * so a map of twelve files is no longer twelve identical dots.
 *
 * ARCS. Lanes bow slightly. That is the usual origin-destination convention and
 * keeps overlapping lanes legible; it is NOT a claim about the sailed track.

 * Stroke colour per mode: sea GREEN, air BLUE, road ORANGE.

 * These read three declared tokens (`--mode-*`) rather than borrowing brand
 * colours, and that is a fix rather than a refactor. Sea was
 * `--brand-blue-bright` and air was `--brand-blue` — the same hue two steps
 * apart, which on a 2px dashed line at this zoom is not a distinction: on the
 * deployed map a vessel leg and a flight leg were one colour. Road was
 * `--primary`, so the third was a function of the tenant's brand and a blue-brand
 * tenant would have lost road onto air as well. See index.css for the values.
 *
 * Exported because the legend renders in three places — the map footer, full
 * screen and meeting mode — and a second copy of this table is how the legend
 * ends up describing a colour the map no longer uses.

                    map used to draw one anonymous circle for all of them, so a
                    twelve-file map was twelve identical marks and the only way to
                    tell a port from a customer address was to read the label.

                    THE TWO AXES STAY SEPARATE. Shape says what kind of place;
                    fill says whether the coordinate is trusted. A reference point

                    address — so adding shape did not cost the honesty the legend
                    describes in words.

                    A cluster keeps the circle. It stands for several places of
                    possibly different kinds, and stamping the first one's shape on
                    the group would claim they are all ports.
