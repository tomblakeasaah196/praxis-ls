/**
 * Control Tower — the home screen.
 *
 * PHASE 3 / AUDIT F1. This was 1,196 lines of React that rendered no React: it
 * built an HTML string from three raw text assets (1,440 more lines) and injected
 * it into an `<iframe srcDoc>`, then grafted live data on by generating a
 * `<script>` that rewrote the frame's DOM with `innerHTML`, bridged navigation
 * over `postMessage`, and tracked the theme with a `MutationObserver` watching
 * `window.parent.document`. Everything that cost:
 *
 *   - A SECOND DESIGN SYSTEM. The frame shipped its own 584-line stylesheet
 *     redefining `--ink`, `--ok`, `--warn`, `.micro`, `.status` and `.st-*`. It
 *     had to be hand-patched twice already to track Phase 1's token retune, and
 *     `--primary` was never forwarded into it at all — so the white-label
 *     promise, the product's core commercial claim, did not reach the first
 *     screen every user sees. It does now: the map's road corridors, the KPI
 *     tints and the launcher all resolve `--primary`.
 *   - NO DESKTOP. The frame's own breakpoints stopped at `max-width: 1180px`.
 *     Above that it was frozen. The layout below has real `xl`/`2xl` tiers.
 *   - FIXED-HEIGHT GUESSWORK. `h-[calc(100vh-7rem)]` hardcoded the shell chrome
 *     at 112px against a real 66px header, `p-6` on `<main>`, and ~37px more for
 *     the sandbox banner — so the frame was mis-sized normally and clipped in
 *     TEST. Content sizes itself now.
 *   - A NOMINAL SANDBOX. `allow-scripts allow-same-origin` together are
 *     documented by the HTML spec as effectively removing the sandbox, and the
 *     theme sync depended on exactly that.
 *   - UNTESTABLE, un-instrumentable, unreachable by ⌘K, and outside the parent's
 *     focus order.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY UNCHANGED: the information design. The KPI band, the
 * drill-downs, the live-shipment list with milestone progress and the route map
 * are a genuinely good dashboard concept — the audit says so, and it was right.
 * This is a rehousing, not a redesign.
