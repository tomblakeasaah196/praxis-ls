/**
 * Per-area accessibility gate (Phase 4 validation: "axe, zero violations").
 *
 * Every screen listed here is rendered in all four of its states and scanned.
 * The four states are the point, not a thoroughness flourish: the audit found
 * screens that only had one or two (F10 counted 28 ad-hoc "Loading…" strings
 * where a skeleton belonged; F11 found 11 screens with no empty state at all),
 * and a happy-path smoke test would have passed on every one of them.
 *
 * WHAT EACH STATE CATCHES, from the findings:
 *   loading    a bare string where a skeleton belongs, and skeletons with no
 *              role/label (F10).
 *   error      a screen that renders its error as raw text, or swallows a 403
 *              into an "all clear" empty state — the Control Tower shipped
 *              exactly that to production (Addendum 6, defect 4).
 *   empty      a screen with no empty state, or one whose copy is the developer
 *              default "No records returned." (F11).
 *   populated  the real tree: heading order, table semantics, named controls.
 *
 * THIS GATE PAID FOR ITSELF ON ITS FIRST RUN. Against one already-migrated
 * screen it found that every list table in the app shipped an EMPTY `<th>` for
 * its row-actions column — `empty-table-header`, on ~90 screens, invisible to
 * every primitive test because it only exists once a column spec meets a table.
 * Fixed in `data-list.tsx`'s `headerLabel`.
 *
 * ADDING A SCREEN. Add an entry to AREAS. If it needs data to render something
 * interesting, give it a `routes` fixture. That is the whole cost, and it is
 * what makes "this area is axe clean" a fact rather than a claim.

 * look almost identical on screen and lead the user to opposite remedies.
 *
 * `errMsg` renders every 403 as "You don't have permission to do this.", and the
 * old `isGated` regex matched `/permission/` in that sentence. So a user missing
 * the reports GRANT was shown "Reporting isn't enabled for this tenant" and sent
 * to a developer-dashboard feature flag that was already switched on. The actual
 * cause — their role — was never mentioned to them or to the admin they asked.
 *

 * an empty state that told the user everything was fine.
