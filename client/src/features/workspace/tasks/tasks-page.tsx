/**
 * Tasks — the board, with the open task in a column beside it.
 *
 * ── THE DETAIL GOES IN THE LAYOUT, NOT OVER IT ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * A board is a surface you keep working on: triage, drag, re-read. A drawer
 * that slides over it and scrims everything behind it takes the board away for
 * as long as the detail is open — and it covers exactly the region the board
 * occupies, so opening a card to read one line costs the whole view. Where
 * there is room for both, there is no reason to choose: the detail is an
 * `<aside>` beside the columns, with no scrim, no focus trap, and the next card
 * one click away instead of one close-and-reopen away.
 *
 * ── THE PANE IS NOT RESERVED WHILE IT IS EMPTY ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * It used to be a permanent 22rem column holding "Select a card to see its
 * steps…": a fifth of every wide screen spent on a sentence about a pane, paid
 * for by the four kanban columns it squeezed — on the screen whose entire point
 * is the cards. The column now exists while there is a task in it, and the board
 * has the width at every other moment. Below `xl`, where a side-by-side split
 * would be two unreadable columns, the same panel opens as a `<Dialog>` sheet.
 *
 * ── WHY THE BRANCH IS IN JAVASCRIPT ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `xl:hidden` around the sheet read correctly and hid nothing: Radix renders the
 * dialog through a PORTAL into `<body>`, so the wrapper never becomes an
 * ancestor of anything visible and `display: none` on it takes no effect. The
 * sheet therefore opened over the board at every width, on top of the reserved
 * column it was supposed to replace. A CSS media query cannot branch a portalled
 * component; `useIsWide` decides in JavaScript, which is also the rule for the
 * 360 screens (guide §3.11).
 *
 * ── THE AUDIENCE SWITCH OFFERS ONLY WHAT THE SERVER WILL HONOUR ────────────
 *
 * `GET /workspace/tasks/board` answers with `audiences`: the list this caller
 * may actually ask for, derived from their RBAC grants and organigramme
 * closure. The switch renders that list and nothing else. The alternative —
 * always showing "Everyone" and letting the server narrow it — is a control
 * that appears to do something and does not, which is worse than not offering
 * it, because the user concludes they have no team rather than no permission.
