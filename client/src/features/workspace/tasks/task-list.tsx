/**
 * The List view — the board's cap-proof twin (13840).
 *
 * ── WHY THIS EXISTS BESIDE THE KANBAN ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The board endpoint is hard-capped at 200 open rows with no indication anything
 * is missing; past that, four columns of the wrong rows read as the whole truth.
 * The list is the honest shape for "over a hundred tasks": it reads the paginated
 * endpoint, which returns the pre-LIMIT total, and it can be searched, filtered
 * and sorted — the things a board deliberately cannot do.
 *
 * Moving a task here is the same Move menu the board offers, and the row opens
 * the very pane the board opens, so the two views never teach two gestures for
 * one action.
 *
 * ── THE TITLE IS TWO LINES, WITH A DOOR ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A row is read, not scanned, so a long title earns TWO lines before it is
 * clamped. Whether it is clamped is MEASURED (scroll vs client height), not
 * guessed from word counts — eight short words fit, six long ones do not, and
 * the answer changes with the width and the tenant's typeface. When it IS
 * clamped, the dots beside the title are a real button: it expands the row in
 * place to the full title, and the same dots collapse it again, without
 * opening the task. Opening the task stays the title's own tap; the dots are a
 * SIBLING of that button, never a child, because a button may not hold a
 * button.
 *
 * The clamped flag is set while collapsed and then KEPT through the cycle:
 * expanded, the span is unclamped, so measuring it would report "not clamped"
 * and the only way back out would vanish with the button.
 *
 * ── THE PILLS SHARE ONE WRAP ROW, AND THE NARROW ROW IS THE ONE THAT WARDS ──
 *
 * Recurrence, priority and status — plus the Move menu — sit in ONE flex-wrap
 * container. The pills are `white-space: nowrap` and cannot shrink, so on a
 * 360px row a "Repeats every day until 20 Sept 2026" beside the title used to
 * overflow the title zone and land on top of the priority and status pills.
 * One wrap row has nothing to overflow into: below `md` the container takes
 * the whole row (title / meta / pills, top to bottom, all of them visible),
 * and at `md` and up the SAME container is the right-hand cluster the row
 * always had. One DOM, one layout, a breakpoint for width only.
 *
 * Day-first: every date renders through `dateFmt`, and a search box is a
 * `<SearchField>`, not a date control, so the day-first gate has nothing to catch.
