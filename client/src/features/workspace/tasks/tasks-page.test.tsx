/**
 * The board's master-detail contract — what these pin, and why each one is a
 * defect waiting to come back.
 *
 * 1. THE DETAIL IS IN THE LAYOUT, NOT OVER IT. The sheet that used to open on
 *    desktop was a `<Dialog>` inside a `<div className="xl:hidden">`, which
 *    hides nothing: Radix renders it through a portal into `<body>`, so the
 *    wrapper is never an ancestor of anything visible. The card's detail
 *    opened as a full-height drawer over the board at EVERY width, next to the
 *    reserved column it was supposed to fill. `queryByRole("dialog")` after a
 *    card is clicked is that regression, and it fails the moment anybody puts
 *    the sheet back into the wide branch.
 *
 * 2. THE CARD IS THE TARGET. Clicking the owner's name — a child of the card
 *    that is not the title — has to open the task, because "click the card"
 *    is what the board promises. Asserted through a child rather than through
 *    the title so a card that only responds on its title line fails here.
 *
 * 3. THE PANE IS NOT RESERVED FOR NOTHING. With nothing open there is no
 *    detail column and no "Select a card…" placeholder: the board has the
 *    width. `<aside>` has role `complementary`, so its absence is assertable.
 *
 * 4. THE PHONE STILL GETS THE SHEET. `useIsWide` answers TRUE when
 *    `matchMedia` is absent — jsdom's case, and the first frame in production —
 *    so the wide branch is the default here and the phone branch has to be
 *    asked for explicitly.
