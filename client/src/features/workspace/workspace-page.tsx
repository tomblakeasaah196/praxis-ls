/**
 * The old My workspace screen, kept as a redirect.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS FILE STILL EXISTS ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `/workspace` used to render a read-only roll-up of approvals awaiting the
 * signed-in user and their unread alerts. Those two things grew real homes —
 * `/approvals` and `/notifications`, each with their own permissions and their
 * own list — and the surface itself became a hub with three sections
 * (see `hub.tsx`).
 *
 * This component is what a bookmark, an emailed link or an open tab from
 * before that change lands on. It sends them to Today, which is the section
 * that answers the question this screen used to answer, and it keeps the two
 * counts visible on the way through so nothing the old page told them is
 * silently gone.
 *
 * It is not routed any more (`app.tsx` points `/workspace` at `WorkspaceHub`),
 * so it exists for the deep links and for anyone reading the history of this
 * folder. Deleting it is fine once you are confident nothing points here.
