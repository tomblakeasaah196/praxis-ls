/**
 * The operations-file link on a task — the file, and the stages of its chain
 * the work belongs to (13920; several stages since 13950).
 *
 * ── WHY IT IS A COMPONENT AND NOT TWO FIELDS IN THE DIALOG ─────────────────
 *
 * The two controls are one decision with an order to it: the stage list cannot
 * exist until a file is picked, and unpicking the file has to take the stages
 * with it. Written inline, that coupling is three `useEffect`s in a form that
 * already has eleven pieces of state — and the second entry point (the file's
 * own 360, which opens the dialog pre-linked) would need its own copy.
 *
 * ── THE STAGES ARE DEPENDENT, AND DELIBERATELY SO ──────────────────────────
 *
 * Milestone labels repeat across files: every sea export has a "Customs
 * cleared". A free milestone picker would therefore show forty identical rows
 * and ask the user to know which shipment each belongs to. Listing only the
 * picked file's chain makes every option unambiguous, and it is also the only
 * shape the server accepts — a stage of another file is a 400 naming both.
 *
 * ── WHY CHIPS AND NOT A `<select multiple>` ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A chain is fourteen stages with an order, and the work usually spans two or
 * three that sit together ("documents verified" and "declaration lodged").
 * A native multi-select hides that order behind a scrolling box and asks for
 * Ctrl-click, which nobody discovers on a phone. The chain laid out as
 * toggleable chips, numbered in its own order, reads the way the file's
 * timeline does: tap the stages the work is on, and what is ticked is visible
 * without opening anything. Each chip is a real checkbox to assistive tech
 * (`role="checkbox"` + `aria-checked`) inside a labelled group.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS LINK DOES NOT DO ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It never moves the milestone. Ticking off every task on a stage leaves the
 * chain exactly where it was, because a milestone is what the company promised
 * a client and a personal to-do must not be able to advance it. The link buys
 * visibility — the file's Tasks tab, the Analytics rollup — and nothing else.
