/**
 * Today — the two panels that were lost when the workspace became a hub.
 *
 * `/workspace` used to be a read-only roll-up of what is awaiting the signed-in
 * user's approval and which of their alerts are unread. When tasks and the
 * calendar moved in, that page became a redirect (workspace-page.tsx) and the
 * hub kept three sections — but the roll-up itself went with the old page. The
 * endpoint was never removed (`workspace.controller.js` → `service.mine`), the
 * full screens still exist (`/approvals`, `/notifications`), and `hub.tsx` still
 * documents "Today keeps a count of what is awaiting approval". Only the
 * on-page summary had quietly vanished, so Today promised a count it no longer
 * showed.
 *
 * These tests pin the summary to the surface: the rows, the empty states, the
 * links out to the two full queues, and the reused self-scoped Recent-activity
 * widget. (A strip of day counts sat here for a while and was dropped by design
 * — the panels and the day list ARE the source of truth, so no number test.)

/* ── the phone truncates, it does not clip ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `truncate` is `white-space: nowrap`, so the element wearing it has a
 * min-content width of the WHOLE string — and an element's automatic minimum
 * size is its min-content width. A title span without `min-w-0` therefore
 * cannot shrink: it widens its row, its panel, and (the panel being a grid
 * item, whose automatic minimum is likewise its min-content width) the grid
 * track they share. Both boxes in the row then run past the right edge of a
 * 390px phone, where the shell's `overflow-x-hidden` — the main scroll region
 * is `overflow-y-auto overflow-x-hidden` — clips them. That is the report this
 * pins: "Awaiting Me" and "Unread Alerts" cut off together on the right, with
 * a long alert subject the thing that triggers it.
 *
 * jsdom has no layout engine, so what is asserted here is the PAIR of classes
 * that makes shrinking possible: the mechanism, not the pixels. The pixels are
 * `e2e/layout.spec.ts`'s job — and note that its phone block's
 * `hasHorizontalScroll(page) === false` could never have caught this, because
 * the shell hides horizontal overflow: a clipped box does not scroll, it just
 * disappears. A gate for this class has to measure each box against the
 * viewport, which is what the class assertions below stand in for until then.
