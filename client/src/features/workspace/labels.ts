/**
 * My Workspace — the words and tones a task or event is drawn with.
 *
 * ── WHY THE LABELS ARE HERE AND NOT IN THE DATABASE ────────────────────────
 *
 * The enum is in the database and it is a state machine: `IN_REVIEW` means the
 * same thing everywhere and code branches on it. The LABEL is a sentence a
 * person reads, and it belongs with the other sentences — beside `tr()`, where
 * it can be translated and where a copy change does not need a migration.
 *
 * Tones are the UI kit's (`ok | warn | bad | blue | orange | mute`), never a
 * hex or a raw palette class: this is a white-label product and the colour a
 * tenant sees is theirs, resolved from `--primary` and friends at runtime.
