/**
 * The drafting interview.
 *
 * WHAT THESE PIN
 *
 *   - The count is honest from the first card. The bar is sized for the whole
 *     interview the server declared (eight fixed + the follow-ups it intends to
 *     generate), because a progress bar that reaches the end and then grows is
 *     worse than no progress bar.
 *   - Only the role title blocks. Every other question offers Skip — a wizard
 *     that will not let you past question five gets an invented answer.
 *   - The follow-ups are generated FROM the answers, and a failure to generate
 *     them shortens the interview instead of ending it. The whole flow degrades
 *     to the fixed eight with no model at all.
 *   - Speaking ADDS to what was typed. Replacing is unrecoverable.
 *   - The salary lands under the two keys the drafting service reads by name.
 *     They are a contract between this file and `vacancy.draft.js`, and nothing
 *     else would notice them drifting until an advert quoted no money.
 *   - The escape hatch is reachable from any card.
