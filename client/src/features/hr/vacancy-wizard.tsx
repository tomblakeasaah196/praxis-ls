/**
 * New vacancy — the drafting interview (0526).
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS NOT A FORM ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The old "New vacancy" modal asked for a title, a department and a description
 * box, which asks a recruiter to be a copywriter and gets a job advert that
 * reads like a database row. This asks questions instead — one at a time, in
 * their own words, typed or spoken — and the model writes the advert from the
 * answers. See `src/modules/hr/vacancy/vacancy.draft.js` for the other half.
 *
 * ── ONE QUESTION PER CARD ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Ten questions on one screen is the form again, and a form is skimmed: people
 * answer "requirements" with three words because eight other fields are
 * visible. One card at a time, with the hint under the question, is what gets a
 * spoken paragraph instead — and a spoken paragraph is what the model needs.
 *
 * The count is honest about what is coming: the server says how many questions
 * there are in total (the fixed set, plus the follow-ups it intends to
 * generate, plus the entity question when it means to ask one), so the bar is
 * sized for the whole interview from the first card rather than reaching the
 * end and then growing. If the model returns fewer follow-ups — or none, when it is
 * unreachable — the total shrinks and the interview simply ends sooner.
 *
 * ── WHO IS HIRING IS A QUESTION, WHEN THERE IS A CHOICE ────────────────────
 *
 * A tenant running several corporate entities is asked which one first, and the
 * server decides whether to ask: it puts the question in the set (and in the
 * count) only when more than one is active, because a single-entity workspace
 * should not answer a question with one possible answer. The choice sets the
 * currency the salary card is labelled in, the labour market the AI proposes a
 * band for, what it is told the company does, and the `entity_id` the vacancy
 * carries into the hire it eventually provisions. Without it a multi-entity
 * tenant got generic copy in a fallback currency on a vacancy attached to no
 * company — and nothing said so.
 *
 * ── NOTHING ELSE IS MANDATORY EXCEPT THE ROLE ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * The title and the company block; nothing else does. Every other question can
 * be skipped, because a recruiter who does not yet know the salary band or the
 * exact office should still reach a draft — the model proposes what it was not
 * told, and the editor is where it gets corrected. A wizard that will not let
 * you past question five is one people route around by inventing an answer,
 * which is worse than a gap.
 *
 * ── AND THE ESCAPE HATCH IS ALWAYS THERE ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * "Skip the questions — start from a blank form" is on every card. Somebody
 * re-posting a role they have posted twice already does not want an interview,
 * and hiding the old form behind the new one would make this feel like a tax.
