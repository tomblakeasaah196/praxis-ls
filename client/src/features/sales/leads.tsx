/**
 * Sales & CRM — Leads, and the inbound intake feed that supplies them.
 *
 * Split out of `features/sales/pages.tsx` (2,596 lines) in Phase 4, audit F7.
 *
 * Intake is a TAB here rather than a screen of its own: the leads list is the
 * funnel and inbound enquiries/partnerships are its raw feed, so triage flows
 * straight from one into the other. `/sales/inbound-intake` redirects to
 * `?tab=intake`.
 *
 * NOTE: the API prefix moved /inbound → /intake on 2026-08-04 (audit API F-6),
 * because wms/inbound already owned /inbound.
