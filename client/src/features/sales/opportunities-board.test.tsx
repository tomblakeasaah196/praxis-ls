/**
 * The pipeline board must account for EVERY deal it is given.
 *
 * Reported live: "the endpoints on that page return data, but nothing is shown
 * on the board". The columns render deals whose `pipeline_stage_id` equals the
 * column's own id — so a deal with no stage, or one pointing at a stage the
 * tenant no longer has, matched nothing and was drawn nowhere. The API returned
 * it and the List view showed it; the board silently held it back.
 *
 * This is the same rule the KPI tiles are held to (they must partition the
 * register — quote_request.rules.assertPartitions): every deal is in a column,
 * or in the column that says it is in no column. Silence is not an option.
