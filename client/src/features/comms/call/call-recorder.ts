 * Call recorder — one side of one call, as a series of complete audio files

 *
 * A MediaRecorder started with a timeslice writes the container header into
 * its FIRST chunk only, so any later slice of that stream is undecodable on its
 * own. This recorder therefore starts a new MediaRecorder at every part
 * boundary (on the same track, before the old one stops, so no audio falls in
 * between) and records each without a timeslice: every part is a whole file
 * with its own header, and each is transcribed as soon as it is uploaded.
 *
 * Nothing here touches the network. A closed part is handed to `onPart` (the
 * durable upload outbox, call-upload-outbox.ts), so hanging up never waits on
 * an upload and a part survives a closed tab.
