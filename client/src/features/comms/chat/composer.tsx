/**
 * The message composer.
 *
 * What it can send, and the one rule each obeys:
 *
 *   text      Enter sends, Shift+Enter breaks the line, and the box grows to
 *             about six lines before it scrolls.
 *   emoji     from the self-hosted picker — no CDN request leaves the device.
 *   files     through the upload ENGINE, never a bare <input type="file">.
 *   voice     recorded here, transcribed server-side, sent as one attachment.
 *   records   a live ERP reference, resolved against whoever reads it.
 *
 * ── UPLOADS START ON PICK, THE MESSAGE POSTS ON SEND ──────────────────────
 *
 * `useUpload({ autoStart: true })`: bytes go up while the person is still
 * typing. By the time they press Send there is nothing left to wait for, which
 * is what makes a photo appear WITH the words rather than a second after them.
 * The deferred mode exists for forms that collect metadata after the pick —
 * that is not this.
 *
 * The consequence is that Send has to refuse while an upload is in flight, and
 * it says which: "Uploading…" on the button is a truthful reason the person can
 * act on, where a disabled button with no explanation is not.
 *
 * ── THE DRAFT SURVIVES, AND IT SURVIVES CORRECTLY ─────────────────────────
 *
 * `comms_draft` has existed since 0430 and nothing ever wrote to it. It is
 * written here, debounced, and CLEARED before the post rather than after — the
 * ordering matters, and it is the same defect class the native-dialog ban
 * exists for: an autosave landing after a send would restore the text the
 * person just sent.
