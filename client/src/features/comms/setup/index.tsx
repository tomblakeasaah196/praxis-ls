/**
 * Comms → Setup — everything about how this company's email is configured, in
 * one place, split by WHO is doing it.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS LIVES IN COMMS AND NOT IN SETTINGS ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * Email configuration used to be spread across three surfaces: section senders
 * and the shared SMTP login under Comms → Setup, mailbox connections inside the
 * Mailbox tab, and a signature blob under Settings. Nobody could hold that map
 * in their head, and "where do I change the address invoices come from?" had no
 * findable answer. It is all here now, and Comms is where people already are
 * when they think about mail.
 *
 * ── THE SUB-TABS, AND WHO SEES THEM ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   My mailbox        everyone. Connect and look after your own one address.
 *   Mailboxes         administrators. The whole inventory: personal and shared,
 *                     health, members, limits, handover.
 *   Send points       administrators. Which sender each part of the product
 *                     mails from — and, next to every row, WHY.
 *   Senders & channels administrators. The existing per-purpose identities, the
 *                     shared SMTP login, WhatsApp and the DNS setup guide.
 *
 * A non-administrator sees ONE tab and therefore no tab strip at all — a strip
 * with a single item is noise. What they may do is answered by the server
 * (`GET /mail/me`) rather than guessed from the modules they can read: read
 * visibility is not the same right as edit, and a tab that always 403s teaches
 * people to distrust the tabs that work. The API remains the authority; this
 * only decides what is offered.

/**
 * The four tabs after "Senders & channels" are PR-5's surfaces, which had a
 * complete server side and no screen at all — twenty-three endpoints reachable
 * only from a terminal. Ordered by who opens them and how often: follow-ups and
 * secure links are day-to-day operator work; response times and trust are
 * things an administrator sets up once and revisits when something is wrong.
 *
 * The two gating decisions are drawn from what the SERVER actually returns, not
 * from how administrative each one feels:
 *
 *   Follow-ups    `workflow.listFollowups` filters on `f.user_id = $1`, so the
 *                 list is the caller's own pending boomerangs. Everyone gets it
 *                 — an operator needs to see what is about to reappear in their
 *                 mailbox, and nobody else's rows are in it.
 *   Secure links  `secure-link.list` has no `created_by` filter: it is every
 *                 link in the tenant. Labels name clients and invoices
 *                 ("Invoice INV-2026-0311"), so that is a disclosure, and it is
 *                 admin-only for that reason rather than by analogy.

   * in. Cleared once the modal closes so a later visit to the tab starts blank.
