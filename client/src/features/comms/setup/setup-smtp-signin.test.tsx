/**
 * "Sending (SMTP) sign-in" on the mailbox forms.
 *
 * ── WHAT THE SCREEN HAS TO CARRY THAT THE API CANNOT ────────────────────────
 *
 * The server can refuse a half-typed separate sign-in, and does. What it cannot
 * do is any of the things that decide whether the operator ever reaches that
 * point:
 *
 *   · The choice has to be VISIBLE. The whole failure this feature ends is
 *     somebody being told their SMTP credentials were rejected while having no
 *     field to put SMTP credentials in. A control hidden behind a disclosure is
 *     only found by somebody who already knows it exists, which is exactly not
 *     that person.
 *   · The form has to REOPEN in the mode the mailbox is actually in. The SMTP
 *     password is never sent to the browser — presence only — so if the screen
 *     guessed the mode from the blank password field, every edit of a
 *     relay-backed mailbox would silently offer to drop its credential.
 *   · A blank password on an EDIT means "keep it". That is the opposite of what
 *     a blank required field usually means, so the form has to say so, and has
 *     to stay submittable.
