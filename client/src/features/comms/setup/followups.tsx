/**
 * Comms → Setup → Follow-ups (§9.3).
 *
 * Every conversation waiting to come back, and the one control that matters:
 * cancel.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS LIST EXISTS AT ALL ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Snoozing is easy to do and easy to forget. A thread snoozed to "next week"
 * disappears, and the only way to find out what is queued is to wait for it. A
 * person coming back from leave, or taking over someone's mailbox, needs to see
 * what is about to reappear before it does.
 *
 * ── A REPLY CANCELS IT, SILENTLY ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The sweep and the ingest path share one rule server-side: a client reply
 * cancels every pending boomerang on the thread. So a follow-up that vanishes
 * from this list without anyone touching it is the system working, and the
 * screen says so — otherwise the first person to notice reports it as a bug.
 *
 * ── CANCELLING IS NOT DELETING THE THREAD ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Spelled out, because "cancel" next to a conversation is ambiguous enough that
 * somebody will hesitate over it. It drops the reminder; the conversation stays
 * exactly where it is.
