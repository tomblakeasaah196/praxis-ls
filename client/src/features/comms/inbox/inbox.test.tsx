/**
 * PR-1A inbox — the three claims worth pinning.
 *
 *   1. A ROW IS A CONVERSATION, and its unread count and star are the CALLER's.
 *      Two people reading one shared mailbox must see different lists from the
 *      same rows; a test that only ever renders one user's view cannot show it,
 *      so these render both.
 *   2. THE CLASSIFIER'S REASON IS REACHABLE. A verdict a person cannot
 *      interrogate is one they will not trust, and "why is this in Notices?"
 *      has to be answerable from the screen.
 *   3. A PARTIAL BULK RESULT IS STATED. Archiving forty and silently dropping
 *      two is the failure the per-id result shape exists to prevent.

  /* ── THE WORK RAIL IS COLLAPSIBLE (review §2 #22) ───────────────────────────
   *
   * The rail was a fixed 22rem column that nothing could shut. On a 1280px
   * laptop — what the operations desk actually runs — that is a third of the
   * pane permanently spent, and long quoted correspondence became a column of
   * six words. The fix has to hold four things at once, and each is a way the
   * obvious implementation goes wrong:
   *
   *   1. There is ALWAYS A WAY BACK. Hiding a panel with no affordance to
   *      restore it is how a feature gets lost; the binding chip lives in this
   *      rail and it is the most consequential control in the mailbox.
   *   2. COLLAPSED STILL SPEAKS. Unbound and overdue are what an operator scans
   *      for, so they survive the collapse as a badge. Hiding the panel must
   *      not hide the queue.
   *   3. IT IS A PREFERENCE, NOT PER-THREAD STATE. Reset it on thread change
   *      and someone reading forty threads re-collapses it forty times.
   *   4. THE PANEL OUTLIVES A BROKEN localStorage. Safari's private mode throws
   *      on `setItem`; a toggle that throws is worse than one that forgets.
