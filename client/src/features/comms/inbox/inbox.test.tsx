/**
 * PR-1A inbox — the three claims worth pinning.
 *
 *   1. A ROW IS A CONVERSATION, and its unread count and star are the CALLER's.
 *      Two people reading one shared mailbox must see different lists from the
 *      same rows; a test that only ever renders one user's view cannot show it,
 *      so these render both.
 *   2. THE CLASSIFIER'S REASON IS REACHABLE. A verdict a person cannot
 *      interrogate is one they will not trust, and "why is this in Notices?"
 *      has to be answerable from the screen.
 *   3. A PARTIAL BULK RESULT IS STATED. Archiving forty and silently dropping
 *      two is the failure the per-id result shape exists to prevent.

/**
 * The reading pane now carries the WORK RAIL (PR-3 → PR-5) — binding, the
 * record drawer, action cards, notes, triage. That is a deliberate change of
 * shape: the rail is part of the conversation view, not a sibling of it, and a
 * ThreadView that renders without it would be the version this programme spent
 * a whole QC pass removing.
 *
 * The cost lands here: the rail reaches the network through `useResource`
 * (TanStack Query) and deep-links through `react-router`, so the pane can no
 * longer be rendered bare. `renderScreen` supplies exactly the providers
 * `main.tsx` does, and `apiClientMock` answers the rail's calls — so these
 * tests still exercise the REAL component tree rather than a stubbed one.
