/**
 * WHERE "CREATE A NEW ONE" LANDS (§7.7).
 *
 * The convert dialog previews and dedups; the record itself is created by the
 * TARGET module, under its own rights, from a form the operator reviews. These
 * six pages are that form: each one renders the owning module's EXISTING create
 * surface — not a mail-owned copy — seeded from the query string the dialog
 * built (`from_mail=1&mail_thread=<id>` plus the prefill), and each one posts
 * back to `recordConverted` after saving, which is what tells the thread what
 * it became.
 *
 * That round trip is the part that never worked. The preview named routes that
 * matched nothing — `/sales/leads/new` landed in the lead dossier with
 * `leadId="new"`, and the other five fell through to the catch-all and home —
 * and nothing ever read `from_mail` or called `recordConverted`, so even a
 * record created by hand stayed unlinked from its email. The routes below are
 * declared in `app.tsx` beside the screens they belong to.
 *
 * Opened directly (no query string) a page is simply a deep-linkable create
 * form for its module — a coherent thing to bookmark, not an error.
 *
 * The `initial` objects are memoised on the query values, not rebuilt inline:
 * the forms re-seed whenever `initial` changes identity, and an inline literal
 * would be a new identity on every parent render — wiping what the operator
 * typed each time anything above re-rendered (the shell polls around them).
