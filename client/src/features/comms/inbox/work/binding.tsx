/**
 * THE BINDING CHIP (§7.1, §7.2).
 *
 * The single most consequential control in the mailbox, and the one with the
 * least screen area: what this thread is ABOUT. Everything downstream — the
 * dossier drawer, the action cards, the AI's grounding facts, the Client 360
 * timeline — reads `email_thread.entity_ref`, and nothing can read it until
 * somebody says what it is.
 *
 * ── SUGGESTIONS ARE SUGGESTIONS ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The server proposes bindings from signals in the message — a reference in the
 * subject, a sender on a known domain, an attachment named after a file. It
 * never applies one. §7.2's rule is that binding is an act with a name on it,
 * because a wrong binding is invisible: the thread simply shows the wrong
 * client's invoices to whoever opens it next, and looks entirely normal doing
 * so.
 *
 * So: each suggestion shows its SIGNAL and its CONFIDENCE, and both are
 * rendered rather than collapsed into a percentage. "The subject contains
 * SLAS-2026-0042" and "the sender is on a domain we have seen before" are
 * different kinds of evidence, and an operator deciding between two candidates
 * needs to know which one they are looking at.
 *
 * ── UNBINDING IS OFFERED, NOT HIDDEN ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A binding someone made in error must be undoable from the same place it was
 * made. Hiding the control behind a menu is how a wrong binding survives: the
 * person who notices it is usually not the person who made it, and they will
 * not go looking for a way to correct someone else's work.
