/**
 * THE WORK RAIL — everything about a thread that is not the thread.
 *
 * Binding, the record, what you can start from it, what is waiting to be filed,
 * what the team said about it, and how it is being worked.
 *
 * ── WHY ONE RAIL AND NOT SIX PANELS ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Each of these was specified separately and they compete for the same screen
 * edge. Rendering them as one accordion with one open section at a time keeps
 * the reading pane wide — which is the thing an operator actually spends the
 * day in — and, more importantly, keeps the COST bounded: only the open section
 * fetches, so opening a thread costs the binding call and nothing else.
 *
 * §3.6's 300 ms budget is not a property of any one of these panels. It is a
 * property of how many of them run at once, which is a decision that has to be
 * made here rather than inside any of them.
 *
 * ── THE ORDER IS THE WORKFLOW ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Binding is first and always visible, because everything below it is empty
 * until a thread is bound and there is no way to discover that from a collapsed
 * section. Then the record, then what to do about it, then the team's notes.
