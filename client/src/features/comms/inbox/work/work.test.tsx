/**
 * THE WORK RAIL — the four rules that are only visible on screen.
 *
 * The server enforces every one of these, and each is already tested there. So
 * this file is not about whether the rule holds; it is about whether an
 * operator can SEE it hold. A guardrail the interface hides is a guardrail the
 * interface will eventually route around.
 *
 *   1. §7.3 — an unready action card offers the SAME BUTTON plus a reason,
 *             never a disabled one. The disabled button is the third way §7.3
 *             spends a chapter refusing, and it is what a UI does by default.
 *   2. §7.6 — nothing is filed silently, at any confidence, and the operator
 *             can correct the machine before filing.
 *   3. §8.3 — a fenced draft still arrives, with the unsupported values NAMED,
 *             and the sources it was grounded in are stated.
 *   4. §8.8 — the one hard block asks for a reason and says, before the person
 *             types, that it is permanent.
 *
 * Plus the one that is purely a client concern: `not_built` is not "empty".
