/**
 * THE PRE-SEND BAR AND THE SENDER VERDICT (§8.8, §9.7).
 *
 * ── TWO DIFFERENT THINGS, DELIBERATELY IN ONE FILE ──────────────────────────
 *
 * `VerdictBanner` is about a message that ARRIVED: is the person writing to us
 * who they claim to be. `GuardrailBar` is about a message about to LEAVE: is
 * this alright to send.
 *
 * They share a file because they share a vocabulary — VERIFIED, UNVERIFIED,
 * SUSPICIOUS, LIKELY_IMPERSONATION — and because the attack they exist for runs
 * through both: an email arrives from a lookalike domain, and the operator
 * replies to it with an invoice attached.
 *
 * ── WARNINGS ARE DISMISSIBLE. THE BLOCK IS NOT. ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * §8.8 defines exactly one hard block: a financial document to a domain rated
 * Suspicious or Likely impersonation. Everything else — no subject, "please
 * find attached" with nothing attached, an oversized body, a language mismatch
 * — is a warning that rides along and refuses nothing.
 *
 * Keeping that line sharp is the whole design. A guardrail that blocks a dozen
 * things is one people learn to click through, and then it does not block the
 * one that mattered.
 *
 * ── THE OVERRIDE IS PERMANENT, AND SAYS SO ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The block is overridable with a typed reason, because a block with no
 * override stops a legitimate invoice at 17:55 on a Friday and people route
 * around it by sending from Outlook, where there is no check at all.
 *
 * The reason goes to `immutable_ledger` — append-only, ten-year retention,
 * UPDATE and DELETE forbidden by trigger. This component says that IN THE
 * DIALOG, before the person types. Someone writing a sentence that outlives
 * them and the mailbox is entitled to know that is what they are doing.
 *
 * The server enforces all of this again inside the send path (`presend.js`).
 * This bar exists so the operator sees it before pressing send, NOT so the
 * client can decide whether the rule applies.
