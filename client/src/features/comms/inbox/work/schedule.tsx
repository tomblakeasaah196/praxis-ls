/**
 * SCHEDULED SEND (§9.3).
 *
 * Two shapes, and deliberately no third:
 *
 *   send_at                    an instant the operator chose.
 *   send_in_recipient_morning  09:00 on the recipient's clock.
 *
 * ── WHY THERE IS NO "BEST TIME TO SEND" ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * §9.3 MUST NOT offer one. Q32 removed the open-rate tracking that would be
 * needed to know it, so a "best time" button would be a number with nothing
 * behind it — the kind of feature that looks like intelligence and is a
 * hardcoded 10am. There is no third option to offer and no amount of
 * client-side wishing that can invent one.
 *
 * ── THE RECIPIENT'S MORNING NEEDS A RECIPIENT TIMEZONE ──────────────────────
 *
 * The server refuses with NO_RECIPIENT_TIMEZONE rather than guessing when the
 * party has none on file. Guessing means a message meant for a Douala morning
 * arriving at 3am, and the operator never finding out. This component says so
 * up front so the refusal is not a surprise at send.
 *
 * ── SCHEDULING AND UNDO ARE THE SAME MECHANISM ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * Both are a delay on the queue row, so exactly ONE of them decides the release
 * time. A scheduled message reports `undo_seconds: 0` — it has a whole schedule
 * to be cancelled within instead of a twenty-second countdown — and the
 * composer must not draw a toast for it.
