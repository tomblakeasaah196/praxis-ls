/**
 * "Sending in 18s — Undo".
 *
 * ── THE COUNTDOWN IS COSMETIC; THE SERVER OWNS THE DEADLINE ─────────────────
 *
 * This ticks down from `release_at`, but it is not what decides anything. The
 * cancel is a request, and the server answers it against the row's actual state
 * — so a laptop that slept through the window, a clock that is wrong, or a tab
 * that was throttled in the background all produce the same correct outcome:
 * either the message is still HELD and it is cancelled, or it has gone and the
 * user is told so.
 *
 * A timer that hid the button at zero would be lying in the other direction —
 * claiming the message has gone when the flusher has not run yet.
