/**
 * The composer.
 *
 * ── AUTOSAVE IS DEBOUNCED AND SENDS ONLY WHAT CHANGED ───────────────────────
 *
 * Every 1.5s of quiet, not every keystroke — and the payload carries the fields
 * that actually moved. The server reads an absent field as "not provided" and a
 * null as "clear it", so sending the whole draft on every save would be both
 * wasteful and, before that distinction existed, destructive.
 *
 * ── SENDING IS OPTIMISTIC ABOUT NOTHING ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The composer closes when the server has accepted the message into the queue,
 * and the undo toast then owns the outcome. It does not close on click: a send
 * that is refused — no recipient, over the rate limit, a mailbox someone lost
 * access to — has to leave the person looking at their text, not at an empty
 * screen wondering where it went.
 *
 * ── OFFLINE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A send that cannot reach the server is written to IndexedDB with the same
 * idempotency key it was minted with, and replayed on reconnect. The key is
 * minted ONCE per message, so a replay, a retry and a second tab all collapse
 * into one queued row server-side.
 *
 * ── EXTENSION SLOTS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * PR-2 through PR-5 add UI by passing a node into a named slot, never by editing
 * this file. Editing another PR's JSX is what makes parallel work fail.
