/**
 * The rich composer as a NEW MESSAGE, opened from anywhere in the product.
 *
 * ── The gap this closes ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * There are two composers. The rich one (./index.tsx) has drafts, attachments,
 * the undo window, slash commands and the guardrail bar — and it could only be
 * opened as a REPLY, from inside a thread. Every "compose" entry point in the
 * product opened the older modal in `features/comms/mail.tsx`, which cannot
 * attach a file at all.
 *
 * That was invisible until a document needed to be emailed WITH ITS PDF. There
 * was no path: the rich composer could carry the attachment but had no
 * new-message mode, and the modal that had a new-message mode could not carry
 * the attachment.
 *
 * ── Why the mailbox picker lives here and not in the composer ───────────────
 *
 * A reply already knows its mailbox — it is the one the thread arrived on. A
 * new message does not, so somebody has to choose, and the composer should not
 * grow a second identity as a mailbox chooser. This wrapper answers "from
 * where" and hands the composer a decided `connectionId`.
