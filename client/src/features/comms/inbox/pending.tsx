/**
 * DRAFTS AND THE OUTBOX — the two lists of mail that has not gone anywhere.
 *
 * ── BOTH WERE BUILT AND NEITHER HAD A SCREEN ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `GET /mail/drafts`, `GET /mail/drafts/:id`, `DELETE /mail/drafts/:id`,
 * `GET /mail/outbox` and `POST /mail/send/:id/cancel` have all worked since
 * PR-1B. `tests/security/mail-client-api-wiring.test.js` even grandfathered
 * three of them by name — "no draft-list screen: the composer autosaves and
 * never re-opens by id" — which recorded the gap accurately and left it open.
 *
 * What that meant in practice, for the person at the keyboard:
 *
 *   DRAFTS   The composer autosaves every 1.5 seconds. Close it — deliberately,
 *            or by navigating away, or because a tab crashed — and the draft is
 *            still on the server, with its attachments, and there is no way
 *            back to it. Not a hidden way; none. The "Drafts" entry in the
 *            folder rail lists the IMAP DRAFTS folder, which by Q11 ("no
 *            provider draft sync") is exactly where our drafts are NOT. So the
 *            one place a person looks is the one place guaranteed to be empty.
 *
 *   OUTBOX   Worse, because the product promises it. Schedule a message for
 *            Tuesday and the composer says, in as many words, "You can cancel
 *            it from the outbox until then." There was no outbox. The undo
 *            toast is the only handle on a queued send and it lives inside the
 *            composer, so closing the composer was the last chance to stop it.
 *
 *            And FAILED rows sat there unseen. A send the queue gave up on —
 *            a rejected sender address, three attempts, permanent — leaves the
 *            row with `last_error` set and tells nobody. The operator saw the
 *            message accepted, saw the undo toast count down, and believed the
 *            invoice went out. That is the failure mode this screen exists for.
 *
 * ── WHY ONE FILE FOR TWO LISTS ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * They answer the same question — "where is the mail I wrote?" — and a person
 * who cannot find something they typed will look in both. Splitting them across
 * two modules would put the answer in two places for no gain; they share the
 * row chrome and nothing else.
 *
 * ── WHAT THESE LISTS ARE NOT ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Not conversations. `ThreadList` renders `email_thread` rows with per-user
 * read state, stars, labels, bulk moves and a folder — none of which a draft or
 * a queued send has. Reusing it would mean teaching it two shapes it has no
 * business knowing, so these are their own lists with their own two verbs each:
 * open/discard, and cancel.
