/**
 * The left rail: mailbox picker, the two streams, folders, labels.
 *
 * ── WHY THE STREAM SPLIT IS AT THE TOP, ABOVE THE FOLDERS ───────────────────
 *
 * Because it is the thing that makes the inbox usable at all. A logistics
 * mailbox receives more machine mail than human mail — carrier notices, cPanel
 * backups, tracking updates, delivery reports — and burying a client's question
 * three screens down is how correspondence gets missed. The split is a triage
 * decision, not a folder, so it sits where triage decisions belong: first.
 *
 * ── EVERY COUNT HERE IS THE CALLER'S OWN ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `unread_count` comes from `email_message_state` keyed on (message, user).
 * Marie and Paul both work billing@ and see different numbers from the same
 * messages. If a count in this rail ever matches for two different people
 * looking at the same shared mailbox, something has regressed to a column on
 * the message.
 *
 * ── SECTIONS COLLAPSE, AND THE RAIL REMEMBERS ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Triage, Views, Not sent yet, Folders and My labels each open and close from
 * their header — chevron right when shut, chevron down when open. Everything
 * starts shut except Folders: the rail opens on what the operator asked for
 * (their folders) rather than a full-page inventory. The choice persists in
 * localStorage, so it is a preference, not a ritual.
 *
 * Two things keep a collapsed rail from being disorienting. A shut section that
 * holds the current selection names it beside the header ("TRIAGE · People"),
 * so where you are is always legible. And navigating TO a row inside a shut
 * section — from the reading pane, not from here, since shut rows cannot be
 * clicked — opens that section, so the selection never sits somewhere
 * invisible. Collapsing is always the operator's own doing.

   *               VIP pill, but the LANE the chapter specifies, where you look
   *               at the VIPs and nothing else, did not exist.
   *   UNREAD      the obvious triage move in any mail client.
   *   ATTACHMENT  "the bill of lading came in last week" is an attachment
   *               search, and it was a scroll.
