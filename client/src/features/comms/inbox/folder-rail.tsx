/**
 * The left rail: mailbox picker, the two streams, folders, labels.
 *
 * ── WHY THE STREAM SPLIT IS AT THE TOP, ABOVE THE FOLDERS ───────────────────
 *
 * Because it is the thing that makes the inbox usable at all. A logistics
 * mailbox receives more machine mail than human mail — carrier notices, cPanel
 * backups, tracking updates, delivery reports — and burying a client's question
 * three screens down is how correspondence gets missed. The split is a triage
 * decision, not a folder, so it sits where triage decisions belong: first.
 *
 * ── EVERY COUNT HERE IS THE CALLER'S OWN ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `unread_count` comes from `email_message_state` keyed on (message, user).
 * Marie and Paul both work billing@ and see different numbers from the same
 * messages. If a count in this rail ever matches for two different people
 * looking at the same shared mailbox, something has regressed to a column on
 * the message.

   *               VIP pill, but the LANE the chapter specifies, where you look
   *               at the VIPs and nothing else, did not exist.
   *   UNREAD      the obvious triage move in any mail client.
   *   ATTACHMENT  "the bill of lading came in last week" is an attachment
   *               search, and it was a scroll.
