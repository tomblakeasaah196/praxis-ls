/**
 * The inbox — folder rail, conversation list, conversation view.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS REPLACES ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The Mailbox tab's "Threads" table: one row per MESSAGE, in a DataList, with a
 * modal to read one. That was a message log, not an inbox. This is the model
 * PR-1A introduced — conversations, folders discovered from the server, a split
 * between human and machine mail, per-user read state, and search.
 *
 * ── SEARCH IS THE LIST, NOT A MODE ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Typing in the box narrows the same list the folder rail narrows. There is no
 * separate results screen, so every filter, every selection and every bulk
 * action keeps working on a search result exactly as it does on a folder. An
 * inbox that behaves differently once you type in the box is two inboxes to
 * build and two to maintain.
 *
 * ── OPTIMISM IS LIMITED TO WHAT CANNOT LIE ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Stars and read state flip locally before the server answers, because the user
 * pressed the button and waiting 200ms to see a star fill reads as broken. Moves
 * do NOT: a move can fail on the mail server, and a conversation that appears to
 * leave a folder and then comes back is worse than one that takes a moment to
 * go. Anything that can genuinely be refused waits for the answer.
