/**
 * What the reading pane actually renders: images held back, history folded.
 *
 * ── REMOTE IMAGES ARE BLOCKED UNTIL SOMEBODY ASKS (§5.6.3) ──────────────────
 *
 * Q32 removed our own telemetry — no tracking pixel, no link rewriting — on the
 * grounds that EU counterparties and an EU entity make read tracking the wrong
 * trade. That decision protects the people we write to. It does nothing for the
 * people who work here, who are on the receiving end of everybody ELSE's
 * pixels: a 1×1 GIF in a supplier's footer reports the moment an invoice was
 * opened, from what IP, on what device, every time the message is displayed.
 *
 * Blocking remote images by default is the only privacy control the programme
 * has left on the inbound side, and §5.6.3 names it. It is also the standard
 * behaviour of every serious mail client, so it surprises nobody.
 *
 * WHAT IS BLOCKED, PRECISELY. Anything the browser would fetch from a host we
 * do not control while rendering the message: `src`, `srcset`, `poster` and
 * `background` on any element, and CSS `url()` inside an inline `style`.
 * `cid:` and `data:` are LEFT ALONE — a `cid:` part came with the message and
 * is served from our own store, and a `data:` URI is bytes already in hand.
 * Neither reaches a third party, and blocking them would hide the signature
 * logo on every internal mail for no gain.
 *
 * WHY THE ORIGINAL URL IS KEPT. Moved to `data-blocked-src`, not deleted, so
 * "Show images" is a re-render rather than a re-fetch of the message — and so
 * the alt text still has something to be the alternative TO.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS PARSES RATHER THAN PATTERN-MATCHES ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * The first version of this file did the whole job with regexes, on the
 * argument that the HTML is already sanitized (`mail.service.cleanHtml` runs on
 * ingest) so nothing security-critical was riding on the parse. The argument
 * was wrong twice over.
 *
 * It was wrong on the merits: `\ssrc\s*=\s*("[^"]*"|'[^']*')` requires QUOTES,
 * and `<img src=https://track.example/p.gif>` is valid HTML that no browser
 * needs quotes for. Every unquoted pixel went straight through the control
 * whose entire job is to stop pixels. A privacy filter with a hole shaped like
 * "the attacker omits two characters" is not a filter.
 *
 * And it was wrong about the risk: CodeQL's `js/bad-tag-filter` flagged the
 * tag-stripping regex below at high severity on PR #271, and it was right to.
 * Matching HTML with regular expressions is a losing game whose failure mode is
 * always silent.
 *
 * So it parses. `parseBody` below explains which parser and why — the short
 * version is that we get the browser's own understanding of what an attribute
 * is, without the browser doing anything about what it finds.
 *
 * ── QUOTED HISTORY IS FOLDED, NOT DROPPED (§5.6.3) ──────────────────────────
 *
 * A ten-message thread renders the same ten messages nested inside each other,
 * so the last one is ten copies deep and the reader scrolls through the whole
 * exchange to reach two new sentences. Every mail client folds this; §5.6.3
 * specifies the three signals to fold on, in BOTH languages, because half this
 * tenant's correspondence is French:
 *
 *   · `<blockquote>` — what most clients emit
 *   · `>` line prefixes — what plain-text mailers emit
 *   · "On … wrote:" / "Le … a écrit :" — the attribution line above either
 *
 * Folded, never dropped: the history is one click away and still selectable in
 * the plain-text branch. A mail client that quietly deletes the quotation is
 * one you cannot use to settle an argument about who said what.

 *
 * ── WHY NEITHER OBVIOUS SPLIT IS CORRECT ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A srcset is a comma-separated candidate list, each candidate a URL and an
 * optional whitespace-separated descriptor:
 *
 *     cid:logo 1x, https://track.example/p.gif 2x
 *
 * Splitting on COMMAS breaks `data:image/png;base64,AAAB` in half, and the tail
 * (`AAAB`) has no local scheme, so an inline image reads as remote and gets
 * blocked — a false positive that hides a legitimate logo behind "Show images".
 *
 * Splitting on WHITESPACE breaks `url1,url2`, a candidate list with no
 * descriptors and therefore no spaces — and there the failure is the dangerous
 * direction: the whole thing is tested as one URL, so a leading `cid:` makes a
 * trailing `https://` look local.
 *
 * So: split on whitespace first (a URL never contains any), then split each
 * remaining token on commas — except a `data:` token, which is the one URL that
 * legitimately contains a comma and cannot contain a space. Descriptors are
 * dropped at both levels, because `1x,cid:b` is one token holding both.

/**
 * Parse a message body into an inert fragment.
 *
 * ── TWO PROPERTIES, BOTH LOAD-BEARING ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * INERT. A `<template>`'s contents live in a separate "template contents owner
 * document" with no browsing context, so `<img src="https://track.example/
 * p.gif">` is parsed and NOT fetched. If this were
 * `document.createElement("div").innerHTML = html`, the pixel would fire inside
 * the very function written to stop it.
 *
 * TABLE-SAFE. `DOMParser.parseFromString(html, "text/html")` parses in BODY
 * context, and the HTML tree-construction algorithm silently discards
 * table-only elements that appear without a table ancestor — a body that
 * begins mid-table loses its `<td>`s, and this function's output is what the
 * reading pane renders. Mail is table-based HTML (our own `compose.js` emits
 * a table layout), so "silently drops table cells" is not a corner case here.
 * `<template>` parses in TEMPLATE context, which permits them.
 *
 * The empty `DOMParser` document is only there to own the element; nothing is
 * parsed into it.
