/**
 * The secure-link viewer — what a counterparty sees when they open a `/s/:token`
 * link from an email.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS PAGE EXISTS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `POST /mail/secure-links` mints `${origin}/s/${token}`, the composer pastes
 * it into mail, and the API half (`GET /api/tenant/public/secure/:token`) is
 * genuinely public. But no SPA route answered `/s/:token`, so the catch-all
 * sent every recipient to `/` — inside RequireAuth — and a stranger opening a
 * document link met a sign-in screen. Inside an installed PWA (scope `/`) the
 * tap never even left the app window. This page is the missing half: outside
 * RequireAuth and outside AppShell, like `/sign/:token` and `/v/:code`.
 *
 * ── WHAT IT DOES AND DOES NOT DO ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * One metadata read (which is also what records the view — reaching the page is
 * the signal §9.4 puts on the timeline), then a plain download anchor. The
 * download is NOT fetched through the API client: it is bytes under a
 * `Content-Disposition: attachment` header, and an anchor lets the browser own
 * the Save dialog, the progress and the retry.
 *
 * ── THE PREVIEW, AND WHY IT IS NOW HERE (review #24) ────────────────────────
 *
 * This header used to end "No preview is rendered — an in-app renderer for
 * arbitrary vault bytes is a sandboxing project, not a viewer page." That was
 * the right call on its own terms and the wrong outcome: the counterparty being
 * asked to act on a document had to download an unidentified file from a link
 * in an email to find out what it was. That is precisely the behaviour every
 * security-awareness programme trains people out of, so the cautious choice was
 * teaching the recipient an unsafe habit.
 *
 * The sandboxing objection is answered rather than ignored, and it is answered
 * ON THE SERVER, where the recipient cannot argue with it:
 *
 *   · `preview_kind` is decided by the API from an allow-list of PDF and raster
 *     images. This page never infers it from the content type — a security rule
 *     duplicated in the browser is a rule that drifts, and drifts where an
 *     attacker can read it. Anything else is download-only, exactly as before.
 *   · The bytes come back under `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`,
 *     `default-src 'none'; object-src 'none'; frame-ancestors 'self'`, and — for
 *     images — `sandbox`.
 *
 * ── THE ONE PLACE THE SANDBOX IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT ────────────────────────
 *
 * A PDF is rendered by `<iframe>` WITHOUT a `sandbox` attribute, and that is
 * not an oversight. Chromium refuses to instantiate its built-in PDF viewer
 * inside a sandboxed frame: `sandbox=""` yields a blank pane (Brave shows a
 * block page), and because the response sets `object-src 'none'` the usual
 * `<embed>` fallback is closed too. A preview that renders nothing is worse
 * than no preview, because the recipient cannot tell it apart from a corrupt
 * file. An image has no such constraint and keeps the full sandbox — hence two
 * branches rather than one.
 *
 * Note the asymmetry with the internal `VaultPreviewDialog`, which also frames
 * `text/plain` and `text/csv`: its reader is an authenticated colleague, this
 * one is anyone holding a forwarded URL. Same component shape, deliberately
 * narrower allow-list.
 *
 * Expired, revoked and never-existed all render the same opaque state, matching
 * the API's single 404: telling an anonymous visitor WHICH applies tells them
 * whether a document was ever there.
