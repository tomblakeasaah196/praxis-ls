/**
 * Signature vocabulary — the words the three signature surfaces share.
 *
 * Separate from `signature-cards.tsx` so that file exports components only:
 * mixing constants into a component module breaks React Fast Refresh, and both
 * the vault page and the settings page need these strings.
 *
 * Everything here translates a stored enum into something a person can act on.
 * The enums themselves (AES_OTP, NOT_ENABLED_BY_TENANT) must never reach a
 * screen — a document a court reads should not need a glossary, and neither
 * should an administrator.
 *
 * ⚠ Read through `look()`, never with a bare `MAP[key] ?? fallback`.
 * A plain object literal inherits from Object.prototype, so MAP["constructor"]
 * returns a FUNCTION — truthy, so `??` does not catch it, and React throws on a
 * function child. The same hole was a High CodeQL finding on the server side of
 * this feature (services/signatures/canonical.js). The maps below are
 * null-prototype and the helper checks own-properties: either alone would fix
 * it, and neither costs anything.
