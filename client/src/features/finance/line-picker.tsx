/**
 * The dictionary cell on a finance document line.
 *
 * Finance used a bare `<Select>` over all 176 catalogue items on three line
 * editors (two invoice forms, one credit-note form) while costing, quotation,
 * cash requests and procurement all used `<DictionaryFinder>`. That is the
 * split the finder's own docstring argues against: an operator reading a
 * carrier invoice looks for "surestaries" and the catalogue says Demurrage, and
 * a flat select answers that with the nearest-looking line.
 *
 * Adopting the finder here is also what gives these forms the equipment step
 * for free — the payoff of putting it in the shared control rather than in each
 * document. One pick of a charge priced per container type becomes one line per
 * type, which is `expandInvLines` below.
