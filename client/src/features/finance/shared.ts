 * per file. That file was 2,581 lines holding 34 components behind 4 exports,
 * with `useOptions`, a local `errMessage`, a local `money` and a local `cell`
 * all private to it — the audit's worst single instance of F7, and the reason
 * the Finance area could not share anything with Operations or Sales except by
 * copy.
 *
 * The local `errMessage` and `money` are already gone: they were folded into
 * `lib/use-resource.errMsg` and `lib/format.amount` during Phase 2 (F6), and
 * the consolidation kept Finance's better 422-`details` unpacking rather than
 * flattening to the lowest common version.
