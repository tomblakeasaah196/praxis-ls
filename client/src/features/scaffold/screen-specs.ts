/**
 * Screen catalogue for un-built screens (rendered by ScreenScaffold / <Planned/>).
 * Each entry is the *planned* structure of a screen: header, tabs, table columns,
 * primary actions and the AI actions that apply there. This doubles as the
 * machine-readable source for doc/FE_IA_BUILD_MAP.md.
 *
 * BE status:
 *   ready    — backend endpoints exist; screen just needs FE wiring
 *   partial  — some endpoints exist (create/list) but the flow isn't complete
 *   readonly — backend is read-only today
 *   none     — no backend endpoint yet (BE dev must build it)
 *
 * AI kind:
 *   read   — the assistant can query this screen's data (no side effects)
 *   write  — the assistant can perform an action here (human-confirmed)
 *   assist — an LLM-generative / inference step (draft, triage, reconcile, verify)
