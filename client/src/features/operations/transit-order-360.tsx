/**
 * Transit order 360° — the per-order rollup, in Details / Cargo / Signatures /
 * Documents.
 *
 * ── ONE BODY, TWO SHELLS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A page on desktop (`/operations/transit-orders/:orderId`), the sheet on a
 * phone. The reasoning, and the shared chrome, are in
 * `components/record-360.tsx`; the rule is doc/FRONTEND_GUIDE.md §3.11.
 *
 * It matters more here than on most records. A transit order is the document a
 * customs broker, a client and a declarant all refer to by its OT number, and
 * until now "look at OT-2026-0114" meant "open Operations, then Transit orders,
 * then find it" — the drawer had no address. It also carries the lifecycle an
 * operator chases (issue -> client signature -> lodge), and the controls for it
 * were at the bottom of a scrolling dialog, below the cargo table.
 *
 * ── WHY THE TABS ARE THESE FOUR ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The drawer was one column: status, actions, shipment, instruction, cargo,
 * signatures, buttons. That is four different questions stacked, and the two
 * that get asked most — "what does this order say" and "does the cargo add up"
 * — were separated by everything else. Details answers the first, Cargo the
 * second, and the two that are occasional (who signed, what is attached) stop
 * costing a scroll on the two that are not.
 *
 * The buttons still bind to `allowed_transitions` from the server, so a control
 * can never exist for a transition the API would refuse.
