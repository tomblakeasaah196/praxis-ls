/**
 * Delay attribution — "who is costing us time".
 *
 * WHAT MAKES THIS ANSWERABLE AT ALL. When a stage completes, the engine measures
 * how late it ran against the commitment and charges that to the tier that owns
 * THAT stage — never the stage whose forecast moved as a consequence. Without
 * that rule every carrier delay would land on internal ops, because ops owns the
 * delivery stage that got pushed, and this screen would be confidently wrong.
 *
 * EXCUSED TIME IS SHOWN, NOT NETTED AWAY. "The carrier cost us four days" and
 * "four days went to a port strike we published as a risk" are different
 * sentences. Collapsing them into one average is how a scorecard stops being
 * trusted by the people it scores — so force-majeure hours sit beside the total
 * rather than being quietly subtracted from it.
 *
 * WHERE IT LIVES. On the Milestones screen rather than a party 360° tab: the
 * tiers here are ROLES (carrier, terminal, customs), not parties, so there is no
 * single counterparty record to hang it on. When per-carrier scoring arrives it
 * belongs on the party; this is the fleet-wide view.
