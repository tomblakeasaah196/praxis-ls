/**
 * The operations file 360 — one body, two shells.
 *
 * WHAT THESE PIN, and why each one is a defect waiting to happen.
 *
 * 1. THE PAGE NAMES THE FILE FROM THE RESPONSE ALONE. The 360 used to be handed
 *    the list row it was opened from, which is how it knew the client name and
 *    the service label. A page reached from a pasted link has no row. If the
 *    `/360` response ever stops carrying the display fields, the regression is
 *    silent — a header reading "SBX-2026-0001 · undefined" still renders — so it
 *    is asserted here rather than left to be noticed in Douala.
 *
 * 2. THE TAB IS IN THE URL. The point of the route is that a colleague can be
 *    sent to a file's Money tab. A `useState` tab would still pass a test that
 *    only clicked, so the deep link is tested from the URL in.
 *
 * 3. THE TAB COUNTS ARE THE TRUE COUNTS. `document_rows` is capped at 20 by the
 *    API. Counting it is a number that is right until a busy file makes it
 *    quietly wrong, so the strip reads the counts the response carries.
 *
 * 4. THE PHONE GETS THE SHEET. `useIsDesktop` answers TRUE when `matchMedia` is
 *    absent, so the desktop branch is the default in jsdom and the mobile branch
 *    has to be asked for explicitly — which is also the production behaviour on
 *    the first frame.
