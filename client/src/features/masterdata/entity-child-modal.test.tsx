/**
 * The entity dossier's nested add/edit modals — accessibility and coverage.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `screens.axe.test.tsx` renders every screen in four
 * states and runs axe over each, which is what caught the dossier's heading
 * order. It cannot catch anything behind a button: it never opens a modal. So
 * the largest forms in this module — the ones this work just doubled in size —
 * had no accessibility coverage at all, and the first defect found by reading
 * the diff back was exactly there: `role_tags` rendered a `<fieldset>` inside
 * the generic `<label>` wrapper, which is invalid, and made the field's label
 * toggle whichever checkbox happened to be first.
 *
 * WHAT IT ASSERTS. That the two field types added here render clean and
 * labelled — the multiselect group and the pickers built from lookups — and that
 * the collection with the most fields is axe-clean when open. It also pins the
 * `is_active` default, because "the box is unticked but the record is created
 * active" is the kind of wrong that nobody reports and everybody works around.
