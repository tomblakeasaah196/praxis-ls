/**
 * Corporate entities → Documents: the attachment UI, asserted against the real
 * dossier rather than against the component in isolation.
 *
 * WHY SEPARATELY FROM `scan-attachment.test.tsx`. That file proves the control
 * behaves; this one proves the entity register actually MOUNTS it, on the tab
 * where an operator would look for it, and that the row reflects what the file
 * did to the record. A shared component with no call site is exactly the failure
 * mode `check-docs.mjs` exists to prevent, one layer up.
 *
 * It also pins the thing the tab is most often misread for. The attachment lives
 * on the ROW, so an entity with no documents yet shows no upload control at all
 * — the file is attached after the record is created, deliberately (a
 * certificate you are holding must be recordable before it has been scanned).
 * That is a real property of the screen, not an oversight, and the empty state
 * has to say so; if someone deletes that sentence, this fails.
