/**
 * Corporate-entity KPI drill-ins (MOD-01) — one tile, one list of the records
 * behind it.
 *
 * The client and supplier 360s each make four of their five tiles the entry
 * point to a browsable list (`party-360.tsx`); the entity dossier's tiles said
 * "12 employees" and stopped there, which left the reader to go and find those
 * twelve somewhere else. This is the same drill-in over the same dialog
 * (`components/kpi-details-modal`), pointed at the entity's own facts:
 *
 *   Shareholders  the people rows already on the 360 payload — the union of
 *                 `role` and `role_tags` (13850), so an owner who is also the
 *                 director is counted once, as the tile counts them.
 *   Employees     GET /employees?entity_id=… (MOD-02). Matricule, job title and
 *                 photo come from the HR master — the drill never re-derives a
 *                 roster from anything else.
 *   Subsidiaries  `structure.children`, the same rows as the Structure tab:
 *                 direct children only, which is what `usage.subsidiaries`
 *                 counts.
 *   Journal       GET /journal-entries?entity_id=… (MOD-55), the set the tile's
 *                 count was computed from.
 *
 * WHY TWO OF THEM FETCH. The tiles are counts computed in SQL by the 360
 * aggregation; the rows live in modules that own them (HR, the ledger). The
 * drill therefore reads them from those modules rather than from a denormalised
 * copy on the entity — an employee's job title shown here is the one HR holds,
 * not one cached at some earlier moment.
 *
 * The Renewals tab's three tiles (Expired, Due now, Approaching) open the same
 * dialog over `renewals.items` for that state — see `RenewalsDrill` below.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. The Ownership tile has no drill: 82% is a figure, not a
 * list (the party 360s treat "Credit available" the same way). The Shareholders
 * and Subsidiaries rows link to what exists — a holding company's own dossier,
 * an employee's row in the HR master, the Journals screen — and a person with no
 * page of their own renders as plain text rather than a link to nowhere.
