/**
 * Corporate entities → People & shareholding: one person, several roles (13850).
 *
 * THE REPORT. "We have a shareholder with full ownership as at now who is acting
 * director as well but there is no option of being a shareholder and director."
 * The tab is even captioned "ONE PERSON CAN HOLD SEVERAL ROLES" — while the
 * schema allowed exactly one, so the operator either typed the same human twice
 * or left one of the two facts unrecorded.
 *
 * WHAT THIS PINS, and why at the SCREEN level rather than on the schema:
 *
 *   1. The person who owns 100% and directs the company appears in the
 *      shareholding table AND in the directors' table — one row, two tables. A
 *      correct schema that the screen still partitions by `role` would pass a
 *      unit test and fail the user.
 *   2. The extra roles are VISIBLE where the person is listed, because the
 *      failure being fixed was a row that read as "owner, not on the board".
 *   3. The quick route: "Add role" on a holder row opens the person's form with
 *      the roles already ticked, and saving sends `role_tags` — the field the
 *      server validates and the 13850 CHECK constrains.
