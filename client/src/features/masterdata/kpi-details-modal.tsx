/**
 * KPI drill-in modal — one tile, one browsable list of the rows behind it.
 *
 * Extracted from `party-360.tsx` unchanged when the corporate-entity dossier
 * grew the same drill-ins (the tiles and the party masters are the two places a
 * number on screen is the entry point to a list rather than a fact). The party
 * dossier and the entity dossier now share one dialog, so a drill-in looks and
 * behaves the same wherever it is opened — including the keyboard path and the
 * 20-row page size.
 *
 * ROWS ARE PROVIDED BY THE CALLER. The party dossier derives them from its 360
 * payload in the client; the entity drill fetches the entity's employees and
 * journal entries from their own modules. Both hand back `KpiDetailRow[]`, which
 * is why this component takes rows rather than a payload.
 *
 * A row MAY have no destination — a person on a cap table has no 360 of their
 * own, and inventing one would be a link to nowhere. `href` is therefore
 * optional, and a row without it renders its cells as plain text instead of a
 * button: the drill still answers "who are these rows", which is the question
 * the tile was asking.
 *
 * `loading` and `error` exist for the callers that FETCH their rows (the entity
 * dossier reads employees and journal entries from their own modules) — without
 * them a slow query would render as an empty list, which reads as "none exist"
 * rather than "not loaded yet".
 *
 * `paging` is for the callers whose rows are too many to hand over at once — the
 * financial dictionary's tiles count every costing line a charge has ever sat
 * on, which for a core charge is thousands. Then `rows` is ONE page, the server
 * owns the cursor, and "Showing 1–20 of 3,412" states the same total as the
 * tile that was clicked instead of the size of whatever prefix was fetched.
 *
 * `viewAll` is the way out to the module that owns the rows ("View more in
 * Costing"): the dialog answers "which ones", and the module is where you go to
 * sort, search and act on them.
