/**
 * Regression test — Configure → Master data → Suppliers must not crash on load.
 *
 * INCIDENT. `PartyDossier` (party-360.tsx) unconditionally read `d.dossiers.length`
 * when building the tab-count map. Dossiers are a client-only field on the 360
 * response — the server's `/suppliers/:id/360` handler doesn't return one — so the
 * expression threw "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')" on
 * every visit to the suppliers page (the list auto-selects the first row on
 * arrival, mounting the dossier). The screen-level ErrorBoundary caught it and
 * showed "This screen couldn't be displayed" in place of the whole page.
 *
 * The intersection cast (`Client360 & Supplier360`) hid this from the type
 * checker, and the axe-test register wires a lighter `master/suppliers` page
 * that doesn't mount `PartyDossier` — so nothing exercised the supplier branch
 * of the dossier until the browser did.
 *
 * WHAT THIS ASSERTS. Rendering the masterdata SuppliersPage with a supplier
 * fixture whose `/suppliers/:id/360` response omits `dossiers` (matching the
 * real server) settles onto the supplier tabs bar — not onto the boundary's
 * "This screen couldn't be displayed" fallback. If someone reintroduces an
 * unconditional read of a client-only field on the supplier branch, this test
 * catches it before the users do.
