/**
 * Corporate entities → KPI tiles that open the rows behind the number.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The dossier's tiles used to be inert: "12 employees" was
 * a figure with no way to see the twelve, and the screens that DO drill in (the
 * client and supplier 360s) never covered MOD-01. `screens.axe.test.tsx` renders
 * the dossier but never clicks a tile, so nothing above the primitive level
 * asserted any of this.
 *
 * WHAT IT PINS, in the order the reader meets it:
 *
 *   1. The four tiles that open something are BUTTONS with an accessible name
 *      ("Open Employees"), which is what makes them reachable by keyboard — and
 *      "Ownership recorded" is not one of them (a percentage is not a list).
 *   2. Each drill reads its rows from the module that owns them, with the ENTITY
 *      FILTER on the request: a drill that asked for the tenant's whole roster
 *      would show the right-looking wrong list, which is the failure mode this
 *      test exists for.
 *   3. The Employees drill carries what was asked for: matricule, job title, and
 *      the photo when HR has one (initials otherwise — never a broken image).
 *   4. The Shareholders drill shows EVERY role a person holds, which is the same
 *      union the tile counted (13850), and a person with no page of their own is
 *      rendered as text rather than a link to nowhere.
