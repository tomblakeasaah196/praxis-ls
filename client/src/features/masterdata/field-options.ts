 * components and helpers cannot hot-reload, and the decisions here — what a valid
 * option list is, what gets sent to the server — are worth testing without
 * rendering anything.
 *
 * A `value` is what gets STORED on every file, cited by every document and grouped
 * by in every report. `label_fr`/`label_en` are what a person reads. They are
 * separate because a label is translated and rewritten and a stored code must not
 * be.
