/**
 * Financial dictionary 360 — the usage drill-ins.
 *
 * The five tiles under a line's header (Costings, Cash requests, Invoices,
 * Purchase orders, Rates) said "14" and stopped there, which left the reader to
 * go and find those fourteen somewhere else — and the question they were asking
 * was always "which ones": which costings, for which client, on which file.
 * Each tile now opens the same drill-in dialog the party and entity 360s use
 * (`./kpi-details-modal`), listing the rows it counts.
 *
 * THE LIST IS THE COUNT. The server reads the same table with the same filter
 * as the tile (GET /financial-dictionary/:id/usage/:kind — see the repo), and
 * pages it: a core charge sits on thousands of costing lines, so the dialog
 * fetches twenty at a time and says "Showing 1–20 of 3,412" under a tile that
 * says 3,412. A capped prefix would have said "of 200".
 *
 * ONE ROW PER LINE, not per document, for the same reason: a costing that
 * carries this charge twice (once per container type) is counted twice, so it
 * is listed twice — with each line's label under the document number so the
 * two rows are told apart.
 *
 * WHERE A ROW GOES. Costing sheets and cash requests have their own 360 route,
 * so a row opens the record. Invoices and purchase orders open their module's
 * list focused on the row (`?focus=`, `lib/use-focus-row.ts`). A proforma or a
 * credit note opens its own list: neither screen lists invoice rows to focus.
 * Rates have no page of their own — every rate row opens this line on Expense
 * rates, which is where a rate is changed.
 *
 * AND THE WAY OUT. "View more in Costing" (and its siblings) under the table is
 * the module that owns the rows, for when twenty-at-a-time is not the job.
