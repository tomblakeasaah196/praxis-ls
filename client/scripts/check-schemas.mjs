/**
 * Shared-schema gate — a schema must be used by BOTH sides, or it is not shared.
 *
 * `check:shared` already proves the package RESOLVES, parses, and gives both
 * halves one Zod instance. It cannot see the failure this catches, which is
 * organisational rather than mechanical:
 *
 *   - a schema lands in `packages/shared` and only the API imports it, so the
 *     client keeps its `canSubmit` boolean and the drift F12 describes carries
 *     on with an extra file to maintain;
 *   - or only the CLIENT imports it, and the API keeps validating with its own
 *     copy — the worse direction, because now two definitions disagree AND one
 *     of them is the one that decides what gets written;
 *   - or a module's validator is migrated, someone later adds a rule back into
 *     the Express file, and the shared schema silently stops being the truth.
 *
 * That last one is the reason this is a build gate rather than a code review
 * item. `packages/shared` existed for two phases with exactly one domain in it,
 * and nothing anywhere said so.
 *
 * WHAT IT ASSERTS
 *
 *   1. Every domain exported from `packages/shared/index.js` is imported by the
 *      API somewhere under `src/`.
 *   2. …and by the client somewhere under `client/src/`.
 *   3. No API validator that has been migrated still declares its own `z.object`
 *      — a migrated file is an adapter, and a `z.object` in it means the rules
 *      came back.
 *   4. Every field in the corporate-entity master shape has a control that can
 *      write it — see WHY RULE 4 below.
 *
 * Rule 3 has an escape hatch (`ALLOW_LOCAL_SCHEMA`) for a validator that
 * genuinely needs a local shape — a query-string parser, say — and each entry
 * carries its reason.
 *
 * WHY RULE 4
 *
 * Rules 1-3 prove a schema is IMPORTED by both sides. That is not the same as
 * being USABLE, and the difference cost the corporate-entity module twenty
 * fields. `entity-common.js` was imported by the client — for RELATIONSHIP_TYPES
 * and PERSON_ROLES — so rule 1 passed, while `share_capital`,
 * `share_capital_paid_up`, `incorporation_place`, `email`, `phone` and fifteen
 * others were accepted by PATCH /entities/:id, listed in the repo's WRITABLE
 * allow-list, and rendered on the dossier's Overview tab, with no input anywhere
 * in the client. They could only ever read `—`.
 *
 * That was not cosmetic. `rules.readiness()` requires `share_capital` and a
 * public email or phone before an entity "can print a compliant letterhead", so
 * the dossier's amber "not yet complete for statutory documents" callout was
 * permanently unsatisfiable through the UI; the letterhead's share-capital
 * block — "mandatory on French invoices" — could be switched on but never
 * filled; and the cap table's CAPITAL_MISMATCH check, which compares issued
 * shares against `share_capital`, could never fire.
 *
 * A field with no control is a field that does not exist to the person using the
 * system, however well the schema is shared. Hence: the shape is the checklist.
