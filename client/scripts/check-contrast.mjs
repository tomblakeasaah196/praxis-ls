/**
 * Design-token contrast gate (audit F13; extended in Phase 5).
 *
 * Parses the real token values out of src/index.css and asserts every
 * text-on-surface pair clears WCAG 2.1 AA. Before Phase 1 six pairs failed —
 * most visibly `.micro` at 3.01:1, which is used 198 times across 54 files.
 *
 * ── WHAT PHASE 5 ADDED, AND THE HOLE IT CLOSED ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * Until now this gate measured status text against `--card`. A status pill does
 * not sit on `--card`. It sits on a TINTED GROUND — `.st-ok` is
 * `color: rgb(var(--ok))` over `background: rgb(var(--ok-fill) / 0.13)` — and
 * the audit said so in as many words: *"these pills pair the failing colour with
 * a tinted background, which is worse than the white-background figures above,
 * not better."* (F13.) The gate was measuring a pair that does not appear on
 * screen, and passing it.
 *
 * That is the same shape as the defect Addendum 6 found in production: a pill
 * whose ground came from one token and whose text came from another, "a contrast
 * pair nobody had measured because neither half was chosen against the other."
 * Twice now. So the pairs are no longer hand-listed at all — the `.st-*` rules
 * are PARSED OUT OF THE STYLESHEET and each one is measured as it is composited:
 * translucent ground over the real surface, translucent text over that. A pill
 * added tomorrow is measured without anyone remembering to add it here.
 *
 * Each pill is checked on BOTH surfaces it can land on — `--card` inside a table
 * or panel, `--background` on bare page — and in both themes. Eight pills × two
 * surfaces × two themes is 32 measurements nobody was going to hand-maintain.
 *
 * ── AAA WHERE IT PAYS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Phase 5's scope says "7:1 for body text, status pills and money figures". Body
 * text already clears it (15.4:1). Status pills do NOT and cannot: a pill's
 * value is that it is legible AND recognisably coloured, and 7:1 on a tinted
 * ground forces the tint to near-white or the ink to near-black, at which point
 * the tone stops carrying meaning and the pill is just text. So they are held to
 * AA as a HARD gate and reported against AAA as a target — which is the honest
 * version of "where it pays", rather than moving a threshold until it passes.
 *
 *   node scripts/check-contrast.mjs [--app client|public-web]
 *
 * Exit 0 = every pair clears its floor. Exit 1 = at least one regressed.

/*
 * 3. FILL TOKENS USED AS TYPE.
 *
 * The token layer already splits ink from fill — `--primary` vs `--primary-ink`,
 * `--ok` vs `--ok-fill` — because the audit measured `--primary` as text at
 * 2.59:1 and Phase 1 created the type-safe value to replace it. What nothing
 * checked was whether the CALL SITES actually used it, and 38 files did not:
 * `text-primary` is what Tailwind's `primary.DEFAULT` makes the natural
 * spelling, it is shorter than `text-primary-ink`, and it renders a colour that
 * looks brand-correct. Exactly Addendum 7's lesson about the raw palette — the
 * wrong thing was easier to type than the right one.
 *
 * A ratio check over tokens could never have caught this: every token in the
 * matrix above was passing. The defect was which token the JSX reached for.
 * Regex over the source is the right instrument, for the same reason the palette
 * gate is a script rather than a lint rule.

/**
 * ── THE ONE GROUND WHERE THIS RULE INVERTS, AND HOW IT IS DECLARED ─────────
 *
 * On `public-web`'s dark marketing plate `--brand-orange` is the CORRECT text
 * colour: 6.44:1 there, against `--primary-ink`'s ~3.4:1. On every light ground
 * the ordinary rule still holds and the fill is 3.13:1. So the exception is
 * real, it is narrow, and it is per-LINE — `SectionHead` and `BadgePill` each
 * carry both branches of one ternary, and the light branch is precisely where a
 * defect would live.
 *
 * A file-level allowance cannot express that, and NOR CAN A CONTEXT WINDOW.
 * The first version of this looked for `onDark` on the violating line or the
 * four above it, which reads sensibly and is wrong: in
 *
 *     onDark
 *       ? "… text-[rgb(var(--brand-orange))]"     ← correct, 6.44:1
 *       : "… text-[var(--primary-ink)]"           ← the light branch
 *
 * the window sees `onDark` from BOTH branches, so swapping the light branch to
 * the fill was excused. That was proved rather than reasoned: the deliberate
 * violation exited 0 when it had to exit 1.
 *
 * So the exception is an EXPLICIT MARKER on the violating line, with a reason —
 * the same shape as the `praxis/no-native-dialogs` escape hatch CLAUDE.md
 * describes, and for the same reason: an exception a reviewer can see beats one
 * a heuristic infers. It is read from the RAW line, before comments are
 * stripped, and an empty reason does not count.
 *
 *     cn(onDark && "text-[rgb(var(--brand-orange))]") // ink-on-dark: 6.44:1 on --hero
