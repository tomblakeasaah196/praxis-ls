/**
 * Motion budget gate (Phase 5, audit F17).
 *
 * WHAT IT HOLDS, and why it is worth a gate at all.
 *
 * F17's sharpest finding was not a colour or a typeface — it was that
 * `.animate-fade-up` ran `translateY(12px) → 0` over **500ms on every card and
 * table mount**. A dispatcher who opens the shipments table forty times a day
 * waited twenty seconds a day for a decoration, and it made a fast backend look
 * like a slow one. Phase 1 took it to 120ms.
 *
 * Nothing stops it coming back. A 500ms fade is one character's difference from
 * a 50ms one, it looks fine in a screenshot, it looks fine in review, and the
 * person who notices is the operator on their three-hundredth use. That is
 * exactly the class of regression a gate exists for and code review does not
 * catch — the same argument the palette gate makes in Phase 4.
 *
 * THE BUDGET. 250ms for anything in the application. The enterprise convention
 * for an entrance is 120-180ms; Linear's whole proposition is sub-100ms
 * response. 250ms leaves room for a drawer slide (the shell's is 240ms) and
 * refuses anything that reads as waiting.
 *
 * WHAT IS ALLOWED PAST IT, by selector and with a reason each time:
 *
 *   - **The front door.** `.landing-*` and `.login-*` are the marketing surface
 *     and the sign-in card: seen once per session, before any work starts, and
 *     the only place in this product where "impression" is the job. F17's
 *     objection is about the workstation, not the doorway. Their long motion
 *     (a 26s Ken Burns, a 0.7-0.9s rise) stays.
 *   - **Motion that carries meaning.** The Control Tower's lane dashes are a
 *     marching-ants stroke on a shipping route: the animation IS the direction
 *     of travel. An infinite loop is legitimate when it is data.
 *
 * IT ALSO ASSERTS THE REDUCED-MOTION UMBRELLA. A budget is not a substitute for
 * honouring the platform preference, and the global kill in index.css is one
 * `!important` away from silently not applying. This checks it is still there,
 * still covers BOTH animation and transition, and still reaches pseudo-elements
 * — where the split-pane rule and every ::before affordance live.
 *
 *   node scripts/check-motion.mjs
 *
 * Exit 0 = within budget. Exit 1 = something got slower, or reduced motion
 * stopped being honoured.

/**
 * FRAMEWORK animations — `animate-*` utilities the app uses that Tailwind ships
 * in its own base theme.
 *
 * THIS SECTION EXISTS BECAUSE THE GATE COULD NOT SEE THEM. Everything above
 * reads `index.css` and the `animation` block in `tailwind.config.ts`, which is
 * every animation this codebase DECLARES. Tailwind's built-ins are declared in
 * neither, so `animate-pulse` — a two-second loop, eight times the budget, on
 * the skeleton that now paints the whole application shell on a cold start —
 * was outside the gate entirely. A budget with a hole that size in it is a
 * budget that will eventually be quoted as proof of something it never checked.
 *
 * So: any `animate-<name>` used under `src/` that is not a project animation
 * must be listed here with the reason it is allowed. The reasons are printed
 * with the rest of the exemptions, and adding one is a decision a reviewer can
 * see — the same shape of escape hatch as EXEMPT above, for the same reason.
 *
 * Both entries below are genuinely exempt rather than grandfathered:
 *
 *   pulse  A LOADING PLACEHOLDER. The budget's argument is about entrance
 *          motion on a screen opened dozens of times a day — motion the user
 *          waits through before they can work. A skeleton's shimmer is the
 *          opposite: it is what is on screen WHILE they wait for something
 *          else, and it must last exactly as long as the wait does, which is
 *          not a duration this file can bound. Capping it at 250ms would mean a
 *          placeholder that animates once and then sits frozen, which reads as
 *          a hung page rather than a loading one.
 *   spin   The same argument, for the same reason, on the inline spinner and
 *          the Button's loading state.
 *   ping   THE LIVE MICROPHONE, and the only one of the three that is not about
 *          waiting. The halo around the composer's mic while dictation is
 *          recording is the same class of motion as the shipping-lane dash in
 *          INFINITE_OK: it is not decoration on an entrance, it is the state
 *          itself. A recording indicator that animates once and stops is a
 *          recording indicator that says "finished" while the microphone is
 *          still open — on a device that is listening to a room, that is the
 *          one failure mode worth spending an exemption to avoid. It exists
 *          only while `listening` is true, so it cannot loop on an idle screen.
 *

 * Both are neutralised by the reduced-motion kill asserted in section 4 — it is
 * a `*` rule with `!important`, so it reaches framework utilities exactly as it
 * reaches ours. That is what makes the exemption safe rather than merely
 * declared.
