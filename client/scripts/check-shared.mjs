/**
 * Gate: prove the BUNDLER can actually consume `@praxis/shared`.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The shared-schema package was written, tested and merged
 * without a single routed screen importing it — so it was tree-shaken out of
 * every build and no build ever touched it. It passed its Vitest suite the
 * whole time. When the probe that first pulled it into the graph was written,
 * `vite build` failed three different ways:
 *
 *   1. `"finalInvoice" is not exported by "../packages/shared/index.js"` —
 *      Vite applies CommonJS interop only to `build.commonjsOptions.include`,
 *      which defaults to `[/node_modules/]`, and packages/shared is source.
 *   2. `Could not load .../node_modules/zod: ENOENT` — the zod alias hardcoded
 *      the repo-root copy, which the Docker clientbuild stage does not have.
 *   3. In dev, `import { finalInvoice }` resolved to `undefined` — no bundler
 *      can see named exports through `module.exports = { a, b }`.
 *
 * None of those are visible to `npm test`, because Vitest loads that CommonJS
 * through Node rather than through Rollup. This script closes that gap: it
 * builds a tiny entry that imports the shared schemas and asserts the bundle
 * both resolves them AND ends up with ONE Zod instance.
 *
 * The single-instance assertion is not ceremony. Zod's exports map has separate
 * `import` (./index.js) and `require` (./index.cjs) entries, so client code and
 * packages/shared can each get their own copy from the same install — measured
 * behaviour before the fix, in dev and in the production build alike. When that
 * happens `instanceof z.ZodType` is false, which is what `useZodForm`'s type
 * contract and form.test.tsx both rest on.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/check-shared.mjs   (npm run check:shared)
