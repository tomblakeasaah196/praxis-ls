/**
 * Doc gate (Phase 5) — the frontend guide may not name something that does not
 * exist.
 *
 * THIS IS F5, MADE IMPOSSIBLE TO REINTRODUCE. The audit's root-cause finding is
 * that `doc/FE_DESIGN_RULES.md` §3 — the onboarding path for a new engineer —
 * told them the default list screen was `<ResourceList>` and that write-capable
 * lists used `<CrudResource>`. `crud-resource.tsx` never existed. `ResourceList`
 * existed with zero call sites. The audit is explicit about the consequence:
 *
 *   "So the documented on-ramp points at a deleted component and a dead one.
 *    Every screen instead hand-rolls useList + DataList + a bespoke Modal form.
 *    THIS IS THE ROOT CAUSE OF MOST OTHER FINDINGS IN THIS AUDIT — there is no
 *    paved road, so 24 feature areas each paved their own."
 *
 * Phase 1 corrected the document. Nothing stopped it drifting again, and a
 * document nobody can check is exactly what produced the original defect: it
 * read authoritative, it was wrong, and it stayed wrong for months because being
 * wrong cost nothing.
 *
 * So: every `<Component>` the guide names in its primitives roster and its code
 * examples must be a real export somewhere under `client/src`. Rename a
 * primitive and the build fails until the guide is updated in the same commit.
 *
 * It also asserts the consolidation holds — every superseded frontend doc still
 * carries its banner pointing here. A stale plan with no banner is the thing F15
 * describes.
 *
 *   node scripts/check-docs.mjs
 *
 * Exit 0 = the guide describes the code that exists.

 * exist" — that story is why this gate exists. The first version of this script
 * allowlisted those two names globally, and it was verified by putting
 * `<CrudResource>` back into the primitives table: the gate passed. An allowlist
 * keyed on the NAME excuses the name everywhere, including in the one place that
 * matters, which is precisely the shape of the defect it is meant to prevent.
 *
 * Context is the right key. A `>` blockquote is where this document tells the
 * history; a table row or a code example is where it makes a promise. Same
 * lesson as Addendum 7's palette gate, which "flagged its own evidence" — except
 * the failure mode here is the opposite and worse: silently excusing the bug
 * instead of noisily reporting the fix.
