/**
 * Prove every gate catches a deliberately introduced regression (Phase 5).
 *
 * Phase 5's validation asks for exactly this: *"CI proven to catch a
 * deliberately introduced regression of each gated class."*
 *
 * WHY IT IS A SCRIPT AND NOT A PARAGRAPH IN A CHECKLIST. Because a gate that has
 * never been seen to fail is a gate nobody knows works. This repo has the
 * evidence: Addendum 4's circular-chunk warning was printed as the FIRST LINE of
 * every build for months and the job exited 0 — "a warning nobody reads is not a
 * gate". Addendum 7 records two gates that were wrong when first written, both
 * found by running them rather than by reasoning about them. And Phase 5's own
 * doc gate passed a reintroduced `<CrudResource>` on its first attempt.
 *
 * Every one of those was caught by DOING this, not by intending to.
 *
 * HOW IT WORKS. For each gate: apply a one-line regression to a real file, run
 * the gate, assert it exits non-zero, restore the file, assert it exits zero
 * again. Files are restored in a `finally`, and the script refuses to start on a
 * dirty tree so an interrupted run cannot be mistaken for an edit.
 *
 *   node scripts/prove-gates.mjs           # every gate
 *   node scripts/prove-gates.mjs contrast  # one, by name
 *
 * Not wired into CI — it deliberately breaks the working tree, and it takes
 * minutes. Run it when a gate changes, and paste the output into the phase
 * record.
