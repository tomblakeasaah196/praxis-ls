/**
 * Post-build gate: assert the emitted chunk graph is acyclic.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. On 2026-08-04 smartls.praxisls.com served a fully blank page.
 * The cause was a circular chunk graph produced by the `manualChunks` config:
 * `vendor` imported `vendor-react` for React, and `vendor-react` imported
 * `vendor` for `scheduler`. The browser evaluated one of them first, re-entered
 * the other before its export bindings were assigned, and TanStack Query's
 * top-level `createContext` call read `undefined`:
 *
 *     Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'createContext')
 *
 * That throw happens during module evaluation, before React renders — so no
 * ErrorBoundary can catch it and there is no fallback UI. The page is blank.
 *
 * The build was NOT silent about it. Rollup printed "Circular chunk: vendor ->
 * vendor-react -> vendor" and exited 0, and CI went green. vite.config.ts now
 * turns that warning into a thrown error, and this script is the independent
 * second check: it reads what was actually written to dist/ and re-derives the
 * graph from the emitted `import ... from "./chunk.js"` statements. A cycle
 * Rollup did not report still fails here.
 *
 * Fixing a cycle by adding another manualChunks bucket does not work — see the
 * CHUNKING note in client/vite.config.ts. The rule is one bucket for
 * node_modules, and route-level React.lazy for everything else.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/check-bundle.mjs   (npm run check:bundle, after a build)

 * property, and flagging those edges would make the gate unusable.
