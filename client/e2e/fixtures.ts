/**
 * A signed-in app with a faked API, for the desktop layout gate.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS MORE THAN "GOTO THE URL". `app-shell` only renders behind auth,
 * and the access token is in memory by design — only the refresh token is
 * persisted. So a browser run against the built `dist/` lands on the LANDING
 * PAGE unless the boot refresh is satisfied. Addendum 7 records exactly what
 * happens when it is not:
 *
 *   "the first run measured the landing page at four widths and reported one
 *    <h1> and no horizontal scroll, all of it true and all of it meaningless.
 *    A harness that renders the wrong screen still produces a confident table."
 *
 * Which is why `openScreen` below ASSERTS it arrived, and every spec asserts a
 * marker unique to the screen it thinks it is measuring.
 *
 * WHY THE API IS FAKED AND NOT RUN. A real API needs Postgres and Redis, which
 * turns a layout check into an integration environment. It would also make the
 * measurements depend on how much seed data a tenant happens to have — and a
 * gate whose numbers move when a fixture row is added is a gate that gets
 * ignored. Everything here is fixed, so a change in a measured number means a
 * change in the layout.
