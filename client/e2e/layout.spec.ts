 *   F9  "~46px rows against a 28-32px standard"             → row height
 *   F13 "~116 of 117 pages have no <h1>"                    → exactly one
 *   F17 "500ms entrance on every card and table mount"      → no page errors,

 * It was called `desktop-layout` for one commit, and the name was the problem.
 * Phase 5's work was desktop-shaped, the gate was written at desktop widths, and
 * a desktop density number (`--row-control-h: 20px`) leaked onto every phone tap

/**
 * THE TITLE BAR STRIP, AT THE SIX WIDTHS WHERE IT WAS WRONG.
 *
 * Two of its controls existed for a pointer and not for a thumb, and the gap
 * between them was a range of widths rather than a device:
 *
 *   SEARCH was `lg:flex` in the strip and `md:hidden` in the bottom bar, so
 *   768–1023px had NEITHER. ⌘K still worked, which is exactly why it survived
 *   review — the keyboard hides the hole from the people who could see it.
 *   That is why 768 and 1024 are in this list: they are the boundaries, not
 *   round numbers.
 *
 *   THE ENVIRONMENT TOGGLE was `sm:inline-flex` while the sandbox banner that
 *   offers "Switch to live" renders at every width, so a phone was a one-way
 *   door out of TEST. 320 is here because that is where the strip is closest to
 *   wrapping, and a wrapped title bar is a window whose caption buttons overlap
 *   the app's own.
 *
 * MEASURED, NOT SCREENSHOTTED, for the reason this file's header gives. The
 * numbers below are the ones this run produces today: at 320/360/414 the drag
 * spacer is 18/58/112px against 86/126/180 before the change, the strip stays
 * one 44px row at every width, and nothing scrolls sideways. The spacer floor
 * is the assertion that costs something — add one more control to the strip and
 * 320px is where it is felt first.
