/**
 * Tests for the no-raw-upload rule.
 *
 * A lint rule's FALSE NEGATIVES are invisible — it reports nothing, the build
 * is green, and the thing it exists to prevent ships anyway. So the cases below
 * are the shapes this rule has to keep catching, and the shapes it must never
 * catch, written from what is actually in the tree.
 *
 * The valid cases matter as much as the invalid ones. `<input type="text">` and
 * `<Input type="file" />`-shaped custom components appear throughout the
 * client, and a rule that reddened those would be turned off within a week.
 *
 * Run with:  node --test eslint-local-rules/
