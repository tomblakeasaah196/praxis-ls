/**
 * no-raw-upload — a file picker must come from the upload engine, not from a
 * hand-rolled `<input type="file">`.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A GATE AND NOT A CONVENTION. The same reason the dialog ban is
 * one: the asymmetry. `<input type="file">` is four characters of thought, and
 * doing it properly is a preview (an object URL somebody has to revoke), a
 * progress percentage (an XHR callback threaded back to a bar), a compression
 * pass, an error state and a retry. Every site that skipped those skipped them
 * because the raw input was closer to hand, not because anyone decided the user
 * did not need a preview.
 *
 * The evidence is in the tree. `FileDrop` has accepted `uploadProgress` and
 * `uploadSuccess` props since the day it was written, and of roughly thirty
 * upload sites in `client/`, TWO passed them. The props existing was not
 * enough. What changes the outcome is the good path being the only one that
 * compiles.
 *
 * WHAT THIS COSTS THE USER when it is skipped:
 *   · no preview — you upload a customs declaration and are shown a filename;
 *     picking the wrong scan is invisible until someone downloads it later;
 *   · no percentage — a 6 MB photo on a corridor connection looks identical to
 *     a frozen screen for forty seconds, so people re-click and double-upload;
 *   · no compression — the original lands in storage and is served back at full
 *     size into a 96px table cell, on every page load, forever.
 *
 * WHAT TO USE INSTEAD:
 *   images / documents  →  <ImageUpload profile="…" send={…}>
 *                          (components/ui/image-upload.tsx)
 *   inside a form with  →  <FileDrop> + useUpload() from lib/use-upload, when
 *   deferred submission     the bytes must not be sent until Save
 *
 * ESCAPE HATCH, deliberately narrow: `eslint-disable-next-line
 * praxis/no-raw-upload` with a written reason beside it, the same shape every
 * other exception in this config uses.
 *
 * DETECTION. Three shapes, because a ban one rewrite defeats teaches the
 * rewrite:
 *   1. a literal JSX attribute          <input type="file">
 *   2. a JSX expression container       <input type={"file"} />
 *   3. an imperative DOM construction   el.type = "file" after createElement,
 *      and createElement("input") followed by a "file" type assignment
 *
 * The engine's own primitives are exempt by PATH — they are the implementation
 * the rule points everyone at, and they must contain exactly one real input.
