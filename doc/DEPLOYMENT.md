# Praxis LS — Server Deployment (Docker)

Plug-and-play deployment for any Linux host with Docker (VPS / dedicated / DTR
hosting). The stack is four containers: **api** (Node 20 + built SPA, single
origin), **worker** (BullMQ jobs), **postgres** (pgvector/pg16), **redis**.

The image builds the frontend itself (`clientbuild` stage) — you do NOT build
the client on the server or commit `client/dist`.

---

## 0. Prerequisites (once per server)

1. A Linux server (Ubuntu 22+/Debian 12 assumed) with:
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh        # Docker Engine + compose plugin
   docker --version && docker compose version
   ```
2. **DNS** — tenants resolve by subdomain (`<slug>.praxisls.com`), so point a
   **wildcard** A record at the server:
   ```
   *.praxisls.com   →  <server IP>
   praxisls.com     →  <server IP>
   ```
   (Replace with your real base domain and set the same value in
   `APP_BASE_DOMAIN` below. A single tenant works with one plain A record.)
3. **Reverse proxy + TLS** — nginx (or Caddy/Traefik). Section 5 has the nginx
   config. A wildcard certificate is required for multi-tenant TLS:
   `certbot -d "*.praxisls.com"` via a DNS-01 challenge.

## 1. Get the code

```bash
git clone <repo-url> praxis-ls && cd praxis-ls
```

## 2. Configure `.env`

```bash
cp .env.example .env
nano .env
```

The compose file overrides the host-specific vars (`DB_HOST=postgres`,
`REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379`, `NODE_ENV=production`) — do NOT set docker
hostnames in `.env`. What you MUST change:

| Var                                             | Set to                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `APP_BASE_DOMAIN`                               | your real base domain (drives tenant-by-subdomain)                                                  |
| `DB_PASSWORD`, `TENANT_DB_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD`   | one strong password (compose feeds it to Postgres as `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`)                           |
| `DB_USER`, `TENANT_DB_SUPERUSER`                | must match compose's `POSTGRES_USER` (default `praxis-admin` — or set both to the same custom user) |
| `DB_NAME`                                       | must match compose's `POSTGRES_DB` (default `praxislsdata`)                                         |
| `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET`, `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET`       | `openssl rand -hex 32` each                                                                         |
| `ENCRYPTION_KEY`                                | `openssl rand -hex 32` (exactly 64 hex chars)                                                       |
| `SMTP_HOST/PORT/USER/PASS`                      | your mail relay (invites, campaigns, dunning)                                                       |
| AI keys (`DEEPSEEK/GEMINI/GROQ/OPENAI_API_KEY`) | real keys, or leave `__rotate_me__` to run with AI off                                              |
| `STORAGE_DRIVER`                                | `local` (default; persisted via the `./data` volume) or `s3` + the `S3_*` vars                      |

Leave `PORT=8080` and `PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH` empty (the image sets it).

## 3. Build + start

```bash
docker compose build     # builds api (incl. the SPA) + worker
docker compose up -d     # starts postgres + redis, RUNS ALL MIGRATIONS
                         # (the one-shot `migrate` service), then api + worker
docker compose ps        # migrate should show "Exited (0)"
```

Migrations run automatically on **every** `up -d` — platform first, then every
tenant DB (live + sandbox). You never run them by hand.

## 4. Create your tenant + logins (first deploy only)

```bash
# create your tenant (its own database, live + sandbox schemas, config seeds)
docker compose run --rm api npm run db:provision -- --slug=smartls --name="Smart Logistics"

# tenant admin (the login you'll use)
docker compose run --rm api npm run tenant:create-admin -- --slug=smartls \
  --email=admin@example.com --password='<strong password>' --name="Admin" --role=CEO

# optional: platform (god-mode) admin
docker compose run --rm api npm run platform:create-admin -- \
  --email=owner@example.com --password='<strong password>'

# optional: sandbox demo dataset (TEST mode)
docker compose run --rm api node scripts/tenant/seed-sandbox.js --slug=smartls
```

## 5. Reverse proxy

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/health   # expect {"ok":true,...}
```

nginx site (`/etc/nginx/sites-available/praxis`) — the two non-negotiables are
the **`Host` header passthrough** (tenant resolution + PWA manifest are
Host-based; a wrong/hardcoded Host = "unknown tenant") and the **WebSocket
upgrade** (Smart Comms real-time):

```nginx
# primary api (:3000) + hot standby (:3001). `backup` = standby only receives
# traffic while the primary is down — exactly the rolling-deploy window, which
# is what makes deploys zero-downtime. Also keeps websockets on one instance.
upstream praxis_api {
    server 127.0.0.1:3000 max_fails=1 fail_timeout=3s;
    server 127.0.0.1:3001 backup;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name *.praxisls.com praxisls.com;

    ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/praxisls.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/praxisls.com/privkey.pem;

    client_max_body_size 50m;            # document uploads

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://praxis_api;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_next_upstream error timeout http_502 http_503;
        proxy_set_header Host              $host;          # ← REQUIRED
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP         $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For   $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade           $http_upgrade;  # ← websockets
        proxy_set_header Connection        "upgrade";
        proxy_read_timeout 120s;
    }
}
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name *.praxisls.com praxisls.com;
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}
```

```bash
ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/praxis /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
nginx -t && systemctl reload nginx
```

Then open `https://smartls.praxisls.com` → the landing/login page (the SPA is
served by the api container itself; there is no separate frontend server).

### 5b. Platform console (Praxis-side admin UI)

The **Platform Console** (`platform-console/` — a standalone React/Vite app for
Root Admins) is built into the image (`consolebuild` stage) and served by the api
container **only on a dedicated admin host**, at that host's root. It talks solely
to `/api/platform`, which is **not** tenant-scoped (mounted outside the Host
resolver).

**Host-gated — this is the key rule.** The console is served **only** when the
request `Host` equals **`PLATFORM_CONSOLE_HOST`** (set it in `.env`, e.g.
`PLATFORM_CONSOLE_HOST=admin.praxisls.com`). On that host the tenant SPA is _not_
served; on every tenant host the console is _not_ served. So
`smartls.praxisls.com/console` (or any tenant path) can **never** reach it — there
is no `/console` route at all. If `PLATFORM_CONSOLE_HOST` is empty, the console
isn't served by the api at all (use its Vite dev server locally — see the README).

**DNS:** point `admin` at the same A record as the wildcard. The existing wildcard
server block (`*.praxisls.com`) already proxies it to the api with the `Host`
header passed through, so **no new nginx block is required** — the host gate does
the rest. Just set the env var and redeploy:

```bash
# in .env
PLATFORM_CONSOLE_HOST=admin.praxisls.com
```

Optional hardening — a dedicated server block that exposes _only_ the platform
API + console on the admin host (belt-and-braces; the app already refuses tenant
data there):

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name admin.praxisls.com;

    ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/praxisls.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/praxisls.com/privkey.pem;

    location /              { proxy_pass http://praxis_api; include /etc/nginx/snippets/praxis-proxy.conf; }
    location /api/platform/ { proxy_pass http://praxis_api; include /etc/nginx/snippets/praxis-proxy.conf; }
    location /api/health    { proxy_pass http://praxis_api; include /etc/nginx/snippets/praxis-proxy.conf; }
    # Deliberately no /api/tenant — tenant modules are unreachable from admin.
}
```

`praxis-proxy.conf` = the same `proxy_set_header` lines (incl. the **`Host`
passthrough**, which the host gate depends on, and the websocket upgrade) as the
main block; factor them into a snippet or paste inline.

**CORS:** the console uses a Bearer token (no cookies) and calls the API
**same-origin** on the admin host, so nothing is needed. Admin is a subdomain of
`APP_BASE_DOMAIN`, which is auto-allowed anyway. If a colleague later hosts the
console on a _different_ domain that doesn't proxy `/api/platform`, add that origin
to the `CORS_ORIGINS` env var (comma-separated).

**First login:** create a Root Admin with `node scripts/platform/create-admin.js`
(the console can't bootstrap the _first_ platform user). Leave TOTP unset — the
platform-tier 2FA verify step isn't wired yet (the API returns 501 if a secret
is present).

**Console capabilities (session 14).** Beyond first-login bootstrap, the console now
manages **platform users and RBAC itself**: a **permission matrix** (roles ×
capabilities, `Roles` page) where you can add custom roles, and a **Users** page to
create/edit/deactivate/delete operators. This requires migration
**`0031_platform_rbac.sql`** (platform_role + role permissions) — applied automatically
by the `migrate` service on deploy (`db:migrate:platform`), so no extra step. Root Admin
bypasses capability checks (like the tenant CEO); other roles are governed by their matrix
row. The console also has **stateless token refresh** now (login issues an access+refresh
pair; a 401 silently refreshes) so admins aren't logged out at the 15-min access TTL — no
config needed, but note there's no server-side session/remote-kill at this tier yet
(deactivating the platform_user via the Users page is the revocation lever).

**Console-driven tenant onboarding (session 14).** A tenant can now be set up entirely
from the console — **Provision → change Plan / capacity / sandbox → Create admin → Go
live** — so `scripts/tenant/create-admin.js` is optional (the console's **Create admin**
button does the same Argon2id write into the tenant LIVE schema). Provisioning also seeds
the tenant's brand display name from the provisioning name.

**AI vendor keys (session 16).** AI provider keys are now **one shared, deploy-wide set** managed only from the
console under **Integrations → AI providers** (the former per-tenant Vendors tab is gone). They live on the
platform DB (`platform/0060_ai_vendor`), are AES-256-GCM encrypted with the deployment's `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, and
the AI runtime reads them for every tenant (`.env` provider keys remain the fallback). After deploy, set each
provider's key + run its **Test**. Full rollout steps: **`doc/PLATFORM_CONSOLE_DEPLOY.md`**.

## 6. Updating a running deployment

**Automatic (CI/CD):** every push to `main` runs CI (lint / tests / image
build); when CI is green, the Deploy workflow SSHes to the server and runs
`scripts/deploy.sh` — build → migrate → roll the standby api → roll the primary
(nginx serves from the standby during the gap) → worker. One-time setup: add
repo secrets `DEPLOY_HOST`, `DEPLOY_USER`, `DEPLOY_SSH_KEY` (private key whose
public half is in the server's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`).

**Manual (same thing, by hand):**

```bash
cd ~/praxis-ls && bash scripts/deploy.sh
```

Migrations are tracked per file — re-running is safe. Keep them **additive**
(new tables/columns, not renames/drops) so the old code stays correct during
the seconds both versions run. If `migrate` fails, the script stops before
touching the running containers — nothing breaks; check
`docker compose logs migrate`.

**Optional but recommended for the deploy user:** a dedicated non-root
`deploy` user in the `docker` group instead of root, with a single-purpose SSH
key.

## 6a. The server's GitHub credential (`could not read Username`)

**Symptom:** the Deploy workflow stops a few lines in and the job fails with
exit code 128:

```
── recording the currently-running build (for rollback)
   previous: b21250dbf43a3f4dfcfdd67681d6bda7aa0f34b0
── fetching
fatal: could not read Username for 'https://github.com': No such device or address
```

Nothing shipped, and nothing broke either — the fetch is the first thing
`scripts/deploy.sh` does, well before the backup and the migrations. The
running build is untouched.

**Why.** The server's `origin` is an HTTPS URL and the box has no GitHub
credential for it, so git asks for a username. A CI deploy is a
non-interactive SSH session with no terminal to ask on, so the open of
`/dev/tty` fails with `ENXIO` — that is the "No such device or address" — and
`set -euo pipefail` ends the run.

It is confusing because **running the same command by hand on the server
usually works**: an interactive login has a terminal, and any credential git
cached there belongs to your user, not to the deploy session. Something
having changed (a PAT reaching its expiry, a re-cloned checkout, a revoked
credential-helper entry) is the usual trigger.

**How it works now.** The deploy does not rely on a credential living on the
server. `.github/workflows/deploy.yaml` forwards the workflow run's own token
as `DEPLOY_GIT_TOKEN` — read-only, scoped to this repo, dead when the run ends
— by **piping the remote script over the SSH session's stdin** rather than
passing it as a command string, so it never appears in an argv that `ps` on the
box could show. That script exports a `GIT_ASKPASS` helper for the session
(mode 700 in `/tmp`, removed by a trap when the session ends), which every git
in the deploy inherits — **including the copy of `scripts/deploy.sh` already
checked out on the server**, which is the one that runs, so the fix does not
have to be on the box before it can get onto the box. `scripts/deploy.sh` then
does the same thing for itself with a per-invocation credential helper, which
is what a hand-run uses; nothing is written to `.git/config` either way. Set
the optional `DEPLOY_GIT_TOKEN` repo secret to override the run's token with a
PAT if the server ever needs to fetch something it cannot reach.

The fetch retries four times (2s/4s/8s) for a network blip and falls back from
`origin` to the repo's canonical HTTPS URL, so a stale remote on the box does
not block a deploy. If it still cannot fetch, the script aborts **before**
checking anything out and says which remotes it tried.

Nothing changes for a hand-run `bash scripts/deploy.sh`: with
`DEPLOY_GIT_TOKEN` unset it fetches exactly as before, using whatever
credential the operator has, and it still prompts if there is a terminal to
prompt on.

**Fixing the server by hand.** Either shape works for a manual fetch:

```bash
cd ~/praxis-ls
git remote -v                    # what is origin actually pointing at?

# HTTPS + a token, per command, so nothing is stored in the checkout:
GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0 DEPLOY_GIT_TOKEN='<PAT with Contents: Read>' \
git -c credential.helper= \
    -c credential.helper='!f() { printf "username=x-access-token\npassword=%s\n" "$DEPLOY_GIT_TOKEN"; }; f' \
    fetch --prune origin

# or SSH + a read-only deploy key (public half added to the repo on GitHub):
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:<owner>/praxis-ls.git
```

Do **not** put a token in the remote URL (`https://<token>@github.com/...`).
It lands in `.git/config` in plaintext, survives every deploy, leaks into any
log that echoes a remote, and outlives whoever set it up.

## 7. Operations notes

- **Backups** — **not a manual step.** State lives in the `praxis_pgdata`
  volume + `./data` (document vault) + `./media` + `./uploads`, and the
  platform backs all of it up on a schedule: a per-tenant `pg_dump` nightly
  (`BACKUP_CRON`), an offsite copy of tenant documents an hour later, a weekly
  integrity scan, and a monthly restore rehearsal that measures the real RTO.
  Every attempt is a row in `platform.backup_run`. Full picture:
  `doc/BACKUP_RESTORE_SWEEP_2026-09-30.md`; console: **Ops → Backup & restore**.

  Verify rather than assume — both exit non-zero when something is wrong, so
  they work as deploy gates:
  ```bash
  npm run db:backup:status     # any tenant stale or never backed up?
  npm run db:restore:history   # has a restore actually been PROVEN to work?
  ```
  Recovery, in order — the database first, because it is the index that says
  which documents should exist:
  ```bash
  npm run db:restore:drill -- --slug=<t> --into=tenant_<t>_recovered --i-am-recovering
  npm run db:objects:restore -- --slug=<t> --dry-run   # then without --dry-run
  npm run db:objects:scan                              # prove every row got its file
  ```
  A hand-run `pg_dumpall` is a last resort only: it is not recorded in
  `platform.backup_run`, nothing monitors it or alerts on its absence, and it
  lands on the host whose loss is the threat it is meant to cover.
- **Logs** — `docker compose logs -f api` / `worker`.
  Pino writes to **stdout only**; Docker's json-file driver holds them, capped at
  50MB x 5 per service (see `logging:` in docker-compose.yml).
  There is **no `./logs` directory** — this line used to claim files landed there
  (audit OBS-L6). Nothing has ever written to it, and an on-call engineer
  following the old runbook at 02:00 found an empty folder. Logs are lost when a
  container is recreated, which every deploy does; shipping them off-box is
  tracked as OBS-L7.
- **Feature flags** — if a module 403s for everyone (even the CEO), diagnose with
  `docker compose run --rm api node scripts/tenant/feature-report.js --slug=<slug>`.
- **Sandbox reseed after admin re-creation** — if you re-provision an admin and
  TEST-mode writes start failing with "Referenced record not found", re-run
  `seed-sandbox.js` (it re-mirrors identity users; see `SANDBOX_TESTING.md`).
- Postgres/Redis are bound to **127.0.0.1 only** — do not change that on a
  public host.
- The api container runs with `ENABLE_WORKERS=false`; the worker container owns
  the queues. Don't run two workers against one Redis unless intended.
