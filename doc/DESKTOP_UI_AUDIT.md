# Desktop Frontend — UI/UX Audit & Remediation Roadmap

**Phase 0 — audit only. No code changed.**
**Date:** 2026-08-04 · **Scope:** `client/` (React 18 + Vite + TS, tenant PWA) · **Reviewer:** Principal Frontend Engineer (inherited codebase)

---

## 0. Executive summary

The verdict up front, because it is not the one the brief anticipated.

This codebase is **not** "no reusable components". It has a real primitive layer (`components/ui/*`), a real token system (`index.css` + `tailwind.config.ts`), shared data hooks (`lib/use-resource.ts`), and a shared list scaffold (`components/data-list.tsx`) that 36 files genuinely use. Someone competent built a design system here.

The problem is that **the system was never finished, never enforced, and is now actively diverging from itself.** Three things follow from that:

1. **The desktop breakpoint does not exist.** The app has 216 `sm:` (640px) prefixes, 22 `md:`, 30 `lg:`, and **zero `xl:` / `2xl:`**. Every layout decision in the product is made at 640px. Combined with `mx-auto max-w-6xl` repeated at **86 call sites**, the app renders *identically* at 1280px, 1920px and 2560px — a 1152px column floating in dead space. This is precisely the "stretched mobile view" the brief describes, and it is mechanical, not aesthetic.

2. **The design system has no enforcement, so it forked.** `components/ui/card.tsx` exports a complete Card set with **zero importers** — while four competing hand-rolled card recipes are used instead. 122 raw Tailwind palette colours bypass the tokens the team's own doc calls rule #1. Six copies of the same error helper exist.

3. **Accessibility is systematically, not incidentally, broken.** 569 form fields render a `<label>` with no association to their control. `aria-invalid`, `aria-describedby` and `aria-required` appear **zero times in ~40,000 lines**. The `.micro` label class — used 198 times — sits at **3.01:1 contrast**, failing WCAG AA in both light and dark themes.

Underneath all of it sits the finding that should be fixed first regardless of roadmap: **the home screen is a static HTML mock in an iframe** (F1).

The good news is that the corrective path is short, because the foundation is 70% built. This is a *completion and enforcement* project, not a rewrite.

### Severity roll-up

| Sev | Count | Headline items |
|---|---|---|
| **Critical** | 4 | Control Tower iframe · no desktop breakpoints · form label association · documented on-ramp is fictional |
| **High** | 9 | Container cap · god files · token bypass · `.micro` contrast · menu keyboard nav · heading structure · dead primitives · no tests · no a11y lint |
| **Medium** | 11 | Loading inconsistency · `errMsg` double-wrap bug · nav IA · focus indicators · state duplication · card drift · typography scale · undefined CSS class · modal focus trap · empty-state gaps · inline styles |
| **Low** | 3 | Icon duplication · FAB overlap · `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` |

## 1. Method & scope

Every file under `client/src` was inventoried; all 96 screens in `app/screen-registry.json` were traced through `app/app.tsx` to their implementing component. Findings below are grounded in file references and counts produced from the tree, not from pattern assumptions.

**Inventory:**

| | |
|---|---|
| Client source | ~39,650 lines across 173 TS/TSX files |
| Screens (registry) | 96, across 17 areas |
| Routes (`app/app.tsx`) | 62 `<Route>` declarations, 20 hub routes with `:section` |
| Feature areas | 24 directories under `features/` |
| Shared primitives | 12 files in `components/ui/` |
| Shared mid-tier | `data-list`, `resource-list`, `tabbed-hub`, `action-form`, `document-view`, `praxis-*` |
| Frontend tests | **0** (backend has ~50 Jest suites) |

A second surface exists — `platform-console/` (8 files, separate vendor-facing app). It is out of scope for this audit but shares none of the tenant app's primitives, which is itself worth noting as a future consolidation candidate.

---

## 2. Findings

### F1 — The home screen is a static HTML mock inside an iframe
**Severity: Critical · Structural**

`features/dashboard.tsx` (1,196 lines) does not render React. It builds an HTML string and injects it into an `<iframe srcDoc>`:

```
client/src/features/dashboard.tsx:1188-1195
    <iframe title="Control Tower" srcDoc={srcDoc}
      className="h-[calc(100vh-7rem)] w-full border-0"
      sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin" />
```

The content is three raw text assets totalling **1,440 lines** (`features/dashboard-mock/body.html.txt`, `style.css.txt`, `script.js.txt`). Live data is grafted on by generating a `<script>` that rewrites the DOM via `innerHTML` (`dashboard.tsx:662, 671, 676, 843, 906, 954-956`), navigation is a `postMessage` bridge (`:726, :747, :970, :987`), and theming is a `MutationObserver` watching `window.parent.document`.

Consequences, all of them live today:

- **Duplicated design system.** The mock ships its own 575-line stylesheet redefining `--ink`, `--ok`, `--warn`, `--bad`, `.micro`, `.status`, `.st-*` (`style.css.txt:11-108`). Tenant white-labelling — the product's core promise — does **not** reach it: `--primary` is never forwarded into the frame.
- **Its own, worse responsive behaviour.** The mock's breakpoints top out at `@media (max-width: 1180px)` (`style.css.txt:401`). Above 1180px it is frozen. The app's most-viewed screen is the least desktop-aware.
- **Fixed-height guesswork.** `h-[calc(100vh-7rem)]` hardcodes the shell chrome at 112px. The real header is 66px, `<main>` adds `p-6`, and in TEST mode a sandbox banner adds ~37px more (`app-shell.tsx:878-886`) — so the frame is mis-sized in the default case and clipped in sandbox.
- **Sandbox is nominal.** `allow-scripts allow-same-origin` together permit the frame to reach `window.parent.document` — which the theme sync relies on. That combination is documented by the HTML spec as effectively removing the sandbox.
- Untestable, un-instrumentable, unreachable by the command palette, and outside the parent's focus order.

The KPI cards, drill-downs, live-shipment list and world map are genuinely good work. They need to be React components fed by the same hooks as the rest of the app.

---

### F2 — There is no desktop breakpoint. The entire app lays out at 640px.
**Severity: Critical · Structural**

Breakpoint prefixes across all `.tsx`:

| Prefix | Min-width | Count |
|---|---|---|
| `sm:` | 640px | **216** |
| `md:` | 768px | 22 |
| `lg:` | 1024px | 30 |
| `xl:` | 1280px | **0** |
| `2xl:` | 1536px | **0** |

Grid usage tells the same story: **111 × `sm:grid-cols-2`** against 7 × `lg:grid-cols-2`, 6 × `lg:grid-cols-3`, 5 × `lg:grid-cols-4`.

Concretely: a form or KPI grid becomes two columns at 640px and *remains two columns* at 2560px. A 24" monitor gets the tablet layout. `tailwind.config.ts` never customises `screens`, so the defaults apply unchanged and the two widths that matter for this product's users are unaddressed.

This is the single highest-leverage finding in the audit. It is also, unusually, mostly mechanical to fix.

---

### F3 — Every page self-caps at 1152px
**Severity: High · Quick win (mechanically), Structural (to do well)**

`mx-auto max-w-6xl` appears at **86 call sites**. It is copy-pasted as a literal in ~40 files and aliased as `const shell = "mx-auto max-w-6xl animate-fade-in"` in ~28 more (e.g. `features/finance/hub.tsx:24`).

`app/layout/app-shell.tsx:890` gives `<main>` no width constraint at all — so the cap lives entirely in the pages, inconsistently:

| Width | Files |
|---|---|
| `max-w-6xl` (1152px) | 86 sites — the de facto standard |
| `max-w-5xl` | `hr/my-hr.tsx` |
| `max-w-4xl` | `help/help-page.tsx` |
| `max-w-3xl` | `settings/appearance-page.tsx`, `components/document-view.tsx` |
| `max-w-2xl` | `settings/login-editor.tsx` |
| *(none)* | `comms/team-chat.tsx` |

Five different page widths, no rule governing which to use, and no `<main>`-level container to change centrally. On a 1920px viewport the data tables — the actual product — occupy 60% of the screen while the operator scrolls.

The fix is not "remove the cap": dense financial tables want width, reading-oriented settings pages do not. It needs a small set of named container widths applied deliberately (see Phase 2).

---

### F4 — 569 form fields have no label-to-control association
**Severity: Critical · Structural**

`components/ui/modal.tsx:440-469` is the `Field` wrapper used by essentially every write form in the product:

```tsx
<div className={cn("space-y-1.5", className)}>
  <label className="text-sm font-medium text-foreground">   // no htmlFor
    {label}
    {required && <span className="text-destructive"> *</span>}
  </label>
  {children}                                                 // no id, no aria-*
  {error ? <p className="text-xs text-destructive">{error}</p> : …}
</div>
```

The label wraps nothing and points at nothing. Measured impact:

| | Count |
|---|---|
| `<Field>` render sites | **569** across 40+ files |
| …with label→control association | **0** |
| …passing `required` (renders a visual `*` only) | 188 |
| …passing `error` | **4** |
| `aria-required` / `aria-invalid` / `aria-describedby` in the whole client | **0 / 0 / 0** |
| `htmlFor` anywhere | 12 (against 647 form controls) |

This fails **WCAG 2.1 §1.3.1 (Info and Relationships)**, **§3.3.2 (Labels or Instructions)** and **§4.1.2 (Name, Role, Value)** at every write surface in the ERP. A screen-reader user hears "edit text, blank" on 569 fields. Clicking a label does not focus its input. Required-ness is conveyed by a red asterisk and nothing else.

Because it is one component, the *structural* fix is one component — but the 188 `required` and 4 `error` call sites show the field-level validation story is also mostly missing (see F12).

Heaviest concentrations: `masterdata/pages.tsx` (50), `finance/pages.tsx` (50), `sales/pages.tsx` (48), `security/pages.tsx` (25), `settings/config-pages.tsx` (24), `master/pages.tsx` (24).

---

### F5 — The documented way to build a screen does not exist
**Severity: Critical · Quick win (doc), Structural (the on-ramp itself)**

`doc/FE_DESIGN_RULES.md` §3 is the onboarding path for a new engineer. It states:

> **The default list screen is `<ResourceList>`** … **Write-capable lists use `<CrudResource>`** (`components/crud-resource.tsx`) — the create / edit / delete sibling … driven by a declarative `fields` spec.

Both claims are false:

- **`components/crud-resource.tsx` does not exist.** No file, no export, no reference anywhere in `client/src`. It is referenced by four docs (`FE_DESIGN_RULES.md`, `UI_DEPTH_OVERHAUL_PLAN.md`, `WORK_DONE.md`, `SESSION_HISTORY.md`).
- **`ResourceList` exists but has zero call sites.** `components/resource-list.tsx` is imported by nothing; the only two mentions in `features/` are comments recording its removal (`finance/pages.tsx:1123`, `security/pages.tsx:4`).

So the documented on-ramp points at a deleted component and a dead one. Every screen instead hand-rolls `useList` + `DataList` + a bespoke `Modal` form. **This is the root cause of most other findings in this audit** — there is no paved road, so 24 feature areas each paved their own.

This is why the roadmap leads with foundation rather than pages: fixing screens without fixing the on-ramp reproduces the drift.

---

### F6 — Duplication: the same UI reimplemented instead of shared
**Severity: High · Structural**

**Card surfaces.** `components/ui/card.tsx` exports `Card`/`CardHeader`/`CardTitle`/`CardDescription`/`CardContent`/`CardFooter`. **Import count: 0.** It is dead code. Meanwhile:

| Recipe | Uses |
|---|---|
| `rounded-2xl border border-border bg-card p-5 shadow-sm` | 12 (across 11 files) |
| `lux-card` + ad-hoc padding/flex | ~40 in 14 distinct combinations |
| `rounded-xl border bg-card p-5` | 5 |
| `rounded-lg border bg-card …` | 4 |

The identical "panel with a serif title and a CTA" block is independently written in `features/finance/hub.tsx:70` (`AgeingPanel`), `:115` (`CashPanel`), and `features/workspace/workspace-page.tsx:29` (`Panel`).

**Error helpers.** `lib/use-resource.ts:10` exports `errMsg`. Five files define their own copy anyway: `features/master/pages.tsx:22`, `features/sales/ui.tsx:12`, `features/finance/pages.tsx:92`, `features/settings/master-data-pages.tsx:19`, `features/settings/config-pages.tsx:23`. **Six implementations of one 6-line function.**

**Money formatting.** `lib/format.ts` exports `money`. Four more exist: `components/document-view.tsx:67`, `features/sales/ui.tsx:31`, `features/finance/pages.tsx:106`, `features/portal/portal-app.tsx:225` — with differing locale, currency and fraction-digit behaviour, so the same amount can render differently on two screens.

**Textarea.** No primitive exists. 18 raw `<textarea>` elements, styled by three separate local constants: `components/settings/controls.tsx:76`, `components/action-form.tsx:15`, `features/settings/store-pages.tsx:26`.

**Icons.** `components/ui/icons.tsx` holds 20 icons. `app/layout/app-shell.tsx` defines **26 more inline** (`:164-345`), `components/floating-actions.tsx` 4 more (`:24-27`), `features/settings/settings-hub.tsx` a `Glyph` switch of ~8. Several — download, search, shield, help, chevron — are drawn two or three times with different path data.

**Tables.** `components/ui/table.tsx` is the shared table; `components/ui/workflow.tsx:888` (`LineTable`) is a second, independent table implementation; and 12 feature files still emit raw `<table>`.

---

### F7 — Component architecture: god files and no page-level decomposition
**Severity: High · Structural**

17 files exceed 400 lines. The worst:

| Lines | File | Top-level fns | Exported |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2,596 | `features/finance/pages.tsx` | 34 | 4 |
| 2,591 | `features/sales/pages.tsx` | 27 | 6 |
| 1,196 | `features/dashboard.tsx` | — | 1 |
| 1,137 | `features/settings/config-pages.tsx` | 18 | 6 |
| 1,061 | `features/security/pages.tsx` | 16 | 6 |
| 1,052 | `features/vault/pages.tsx` | 12 | 5 |
| 1,035 | `features/commercial/pages.tsx` | 11 | 4 |
| 941 | `features/operations/pages.tsx` | 14 | 4 |
| 938 | `features/governance/pages.tsx` | 18 | 4 |

`finance/pages.tsx` holds 34 components — modal forms, tables, KPI blocks, a local `useOptions` hook (`:71`), a local `errMessage` (`:92`), a local `money` (`:106`) — behind 4 exports. Nothing inside is reachable, testable or reusable from elsewhere; a sibling screen needing the same journal-line editor must copy it.

**Coupling.** `features/finance/pages.tsx:22` imports `SearchSelect` from `features/sales/ui.tsx` — Finance depends on Sales for a form control. `features/dashboard.tsx:20` imports `errMsg` from `features/sales/ui.tsx`. Feature areas reach sideways into each other because there is no shared home for these.

**Prop drilling is *not* a significant problem here**, and it is worth being accurate about that: pages are flat, and there are only three contexts (`auth-context`, `branding-context`, `tabbed-hub`'s `HubTabsContext`). The architectural debt is file size and missing extraction, not deep prop chains.

**One genuine anti-pattern:** `components/tabbed-hub.tsx` publishes its tab bar through React context and relies on each child page to render `<HubTabs/>` in the right place — with an `inlineTabs` escape hatch (`:28`) for hubs whose pages forgot. Whether a hub's tabs appear depends on a convention no type signature enforces.

---

### F8 — Data fetching: no cache, duplicate requests, client-side filtering
**Severity: High · Structural**

There is no data layer. 148 `useEffect`s, 161 `useList`/`useResource` calls, and **196 raw `tenant()` calls made directly inside components** — roughly half of all fetching bypasses the shared hooks.

`useList` (`lib/use-resource.ts:18`) has no cache, no deduplication, no stale-while-revalidate. Every mount refetches. `features/finance/hub.tsx:145-163` fires **nine concurrent requests** on load — `/clients`, `/operations`, `/final-invoices`, `/proformas/advances`, `/receivables`, `/journal-entries`, `/treasury-accounts`, plus trial balance and ageing — then filters **entirely client-side** (`:170`, `hit()`), and re-fetches all nine every time the user navigates back.

For an ERP whose tables will reach five and six figures of rows, unpaginated fetch-everything-then-filter is a correctness and cost problem, not only a performance one. `/clients` and `/operations` in particular are fetched by many screens purely to build an id→name map (`finance/hub.tsx:33`, `:149`) — a lookup that belongs in a cached shared resource.

---

### F9 — Responsive failures beyond the breakpoint gap
**Severity: Medium–High · Mixed**

To be accurate: **the two patterns the brief specifically flags are handled correctly.** The bottom nav is `md:hidden` (`app-shell.tsx:676`) and the hamburger is `md:hidden` (`:786`). They do not leak onto desktop. What leaks is subtler:

- **12 of 16 top-level areas are behind an overlay drawer on every viewport.** `TOPBAR` inlines only `["Overview", "Operations", "Fleet", "Finance"]` (`app-shell.tsx:148`) out of 16 `NAV` groups. Commercial, Sales, Procurement, Costing, Warehouse, HR, Master data, Vault, Comms, Security, Governance and Settings are reachable only through "More", which opens a `fixed inset-0` scrim + 288px drawer (`:860-873`) — a phone navigation pattern, on a 2560px screen with several hundred pixels of unused top bar. Desktop users pay two clicks and a full-screen overlay to reach three quarters of the product.
- **`DataList` swaps to cards below `sm:`** (`data-list.tsx:87`, `:116`) — correct — but the table branch above `sm:` never adapts again. Column count, density and truncation are identical at 641px and 2560px.
- **The mobile card fallback is not keyboard accessible.** `onRowClick` is attached to a `<div>` (`data-list.tsx:120`) with no `role`, `tabIndex` or key handler.
- **Fixed viewport maths.** `dashboard.tsx:1191` (`h-[calc(100vh-7rem)]`, see F1) and the FAB's `bottom-24 right-5 md:bottom-6` (`floating-actions.tsx:113`).
- **The draggable FAB overlaps content at any width** (`floating-actions.tsx`) and persists its position in `localStorage`. A draggable floating cluster is a touch idiom; on desktop it covers the bottom-right of every table and duplicates the copilot entry point that already exists.
- **Information density is uniformly low.** `TD` is `px-4 py-3.5` (`ui/table.tsx:755`) with no compact variant — reasonable for touch, wasteful for an operator scanning 200 shipment rows on a large display.

---

### F10 — Loading states: five different idioms, inconsistently applied
**Severity: Medium · Quick win**

The primitives are good (`ui/skeleton.tsx` even documents *when* to use which). Adoption is not:

| Idiom | Uses |
|---|---|
| `<SkeletonTable>` | 46 |
| ad-hoc `Loading…` text | **28** |
| `<LoadingRow>` | 10 |
| `<PageSkeleton>` | 3 |
| `<Spinner>` | 2 |
| `"…"` substituted for a value | 6 |

15 sites hand-roll `<div className="py-8 text-center micro">Loading…</div>` — e.g. `features/workspace/workspace-page.tsx:52`, `finance/receivables.tsx:146`, `finance/debt.tsx:130`, `governance/pages.tsx:766`, `ai-control/pages.tsx:159`. Two sibling Finance screens use different loading affordances for the same shape of content.

`PageSkeleton` — the best of them, drawing header, toolbar, tiles and rows — is used **3 times in 96 screens**.

Additional issues: `Button` has a `loading` prop that renders a spinner but sets no `aria-busy`; skeletons carry `role="status"` (`skeleton.tsx:27`, `:54`) but there is no live region announcing *completion*, so screen-reader users get no arrival signal.

---

### F11 — Empty states: good primitive, uneven coverage, generic copy
**Severity: Medium · Quick win**

`DataList` requires an `empty` prop and falls back to `"Nothing here yet" / "No records returned."` — a developer-facing sentence that tells an operator nothing.

Where `empty` *is* supplied, the copy is genuinely good — `finance/hub.tsx:259`: *"No invoices — Issue a final invoice from an approved costing."* That is the standard the rest should meet.

Screens with **no empty state at all**: `features/dashboard.tsx` (the home screen), `features/wms/equipment.tsx`, `features/wms/locations.tsx`, `features/security/my-security.tsx`, `features/security/permission-matrix-page.tsx`, `features/settings/appearance-page.tsx`, `features/settings/login-editor.tsx`, `features/settings/document-templates-page.tsx`, `features/comms/setup.tsx`, `features/comms/team-chat.tsx`, `features/workspace/workspace-page.tsx`.

No empty state anywhere offers a **primary action** — the pattern that turns an empty table into an onboarding step. `EmptyState` (`ui/states.tsx:710`) accepts only `title` and `hint`; it needs an `action` slot.

---

### F12 — Errors & edge cases, including a live defect
**Severity: Medium–High · Mixed**

**A real bug: `errMsg` applied twice, discarding the server's message.**
`useList`/`useResource` already return `error` as a **formatted string** (`lib/use-resource.ts:30`, `:47`). 16 call sites pass that string through `errMsg()` *again*. Because a string is not an `ApiError`, `errMsg` falls to its default branch and returns the generic `"Something went wrong."` — **overwriting the real, specific error**, including the 403 permission message the helper exists to produce.

Confirmed at: `hr/attendance.tsx:68`, `hr/payroll.tsx:124`, `governance/pages.tsx:766`, `finance/receivables.tsx:146`, `finance/debt.tsx:130`, `workspace/workspace-page.tsx:54`, `operations/pages.tsx:304`, `comms/setup.tsx:209`, `comms/mail.tsx:64/147/239/305/306`, `comms/team-chat.tsx:232/305`, `ai-control/pages.tsx:159`.

**A second real bug: an undefined CSS class.** `features/scaffold/screen-scaffold.tsx:28` maps the `readonly` backend status to `"st-info"`. `index.css` defines `.st-blue`, `.st-orange`, `.st-ok`, `.st-warn`, `.st-bad`, `.st-mute` — **there is no `.st-info`**. Every read-only screen scaffold renders an unstyled, colourless status pill.

**Structural gaps:**
- **No error boundary anywhere.** A render-time throw in any screen blanks the entire SPA. There is no `componentDidCatch`/`ErrorBoundary` in the client.
- **Field-level validation is effectively absent** — 4 of 569 `Field`s receive an `error` (F4). Validation is enforced server-side and surfaced as one banner string; the user is not told *which* field failed. `finance/pages.tsx:92-104` does parse 422 `details` into `"field: message"` text, but flattens it into a single sentence rather than routing it to the offending inputs.
- **No form library and no schema sharing.** The backend validates with Zod (`package.json`), and the README describes a `packages/shared` for exactly this — but that directory does not exist, and the client re-implements validation as ad-hoc booleans (e.g. `finance/pages.tsx:141`, `canSubmit`).
- `components/action-error-banner.tsx` is a retrofit explicitly documented (`app-shell.tsx:896-898`) as covering "screens whose handlers had no catch" — a known, tracked gap.

### F13 — Accessibility
**Severity: Critical (aggregate) · Structural**

Benchmark: **WCAG 2.1 AA as the floor.**

**Colour contrast — measured, not estimated.**

| Ratio | | Token / usage |
|---|---|---|
| **3.01:1** | ❌ FAIL | `.micro` — `--ink-3` on `--card`, light |
| **2.78:1** | ❌ FAIL | `.micro` on `--background`, light |
| **3.89:1** | ❌ FAIL | `.micro` on `--card`, dark |
| **2.59:1** | ❌ FAIL | `--primary` orange text on `--card` |
| **3.53:1** | ❌ FAIL | `--warn` text on `--card` |
| **3.83:1** | ❌ FAIL | `--ok` text on `--card` |
| 4.54:1 | ✅ pass | `--bad` text on `--card` |
| 6.21:1 | ✅ pass | `--muted-foreground` on `--card` |
| 5.93:1 | ✅ pass | `TH` label on `--secondary` |

`.micro` is 10px, uppercase, `0.19em` tracked — unambiguously "normal text" under WCAG (large = 18.66px bold / 24px). It is used **198 times across 54 files** for eyebrows, table captions, empty-state text and loading text, and `doc/FE_DESIGN_RULES.md` §2 recommends it. It fails AA in *both* themes.

The `--ok`/`--warn`/`--primary` failures matter because status pills (`.status`, 10.5px bold) are how the ERP communicates document state — the most semantically loaded text in the product. Note these pills pair the failing colour with a *tinted* background, which is worse than the white-background figures above, not better.

**Keyboard & focus.**
- **No focus indicator on `.chip`, `.lux-navlink`, or `.lux-botnav-btn`** — `index.css` defines no `:focus-visible` rule for any of them. The primary navigation and every filter chip are invisible to keyboard users. The `Button` primitive *does* ring correctly (`ui/button.tsx:65`).
- **`role="menu"` without menu keyboard semantics** at `app-shell.tsx:440`, `:530` and `notification-bell.tsx:111`. `app/layout/app-shell.tsx` contains **zero `onKeyDown` handlers**. Declaring `role="menu"`/`role="menuitem"` promises arrow-key navigation, Home/End and type-ahead, and strips the underlying link semantics — so this is actively worse than plain links would be.
- **No focus trap and no focus restoration in `Modal`** (`ui/modal.tsx:380-390`) — it handles Escape and body-scroll lock only. Tab moves focus behind the dialog; on close, focus is lost to `<body>`. **WCAG §2.4.3.** This affects every write form in the product.
- **Tabs are not tabs.** `components/tabbed-hub.tsx:41-57` renders a `<div>` of `<button>`s with no `role="tablist"`/`role="tab"`/`aria-selected` and no arrow-key handling. Same in `screen-scaffold.tsx:62-76`.
- **23 `onClick` handlers on non-interactive elements** (`div`/`tr`/`li`/`span`/`td`) across 16 files — no `role`, `tabIndex` or key handler. Only 6 `onKeyDown` handlers exist app-wide.
- **No skip link** to `<main>`. With 12 nav areas behind an overlay, keyboard users tab through the full header on every navigation.

**Semantics.**
- **~116 of 117 pages have no `<h1>`.** `PageHeader` (`data-list.tsx:44-54`) renders `<h1>` *only* when `description` is absent — and 116 of 117 call sites pass one. The title degrades to a `.micro` `<div>` and the description becomes a `<p>`. Only ~9 real page `<h1>`s exist. Heading order is also arbitrary: `<h3>` appears inside pages with no `<h2>` (`finance/hub.tsx:71`, `:116`).
- **Labels:** see F4 — 569 unassociated fields, 0 ARIA state attributes.
- **Live regions:** 3 in ~40,000 lines (`skeleton.tsx:27`, `:54`, `action-error-banner.tsx:29`). Async success/failure is announced nowhere.
- `<table>` elements have no `<caption>` and no `scope` on `<th>`.

**Tooling:** `client/eslint.config.js` has no `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`. Nothing prevents regression.

**Where AAA is worth pursuing:** body text contrast (7:1) is nearly met already at 6.21:1 — worth locking in for `--muted-foreground` while retuning `.micro`. Status pills and money figures are the other candidates: they carry financial meaning where misreading has real cost.

### F14 — Visual & UX consistency
**Severity: Medium · Mixed**

**Typography has no scale.** 19 distinct sizes in use — 7 Tailwind steps (`text-sm` ×470, `text-xs` ×171, `text-lg` ×33, `text-base` ×12, `text-2xl` ×10, `text-xl` ×6, `text-3xl` ×2) plus **12 arbitrary pixel values**: `text-[11px]` ×30, `[13px]` ×15, `[10px]` ×7, `[9px]` ×5, `[15px]`, `[12px]`, `[9.5px]`, `[22px]`, `[18px]`, `[14px]`, `[12.5px]`, `[11.5px]`. `tailwind.config.ts` extends `colors`, `borderRadius`, `keyframes` and `animation` — but **not `fontSize` or `spacing`**. There are no typography tokens, so every developer picks a pixel value.

Page titles are consequently inconsistent: `text-[22px]` (`data-list.tsx:53`), `text-3xl` (`finance/hub.tsx:208`, `help-page.tsx:34`), `text-2xl` (`settings-hub.tsx:117`, `screen-scaffold.tsx:44`, `comms/setup.tsx:201`).

**Colour tokens are bypassed 122 times.** `doc/FE_DESIGN_RULES.md` rule #1 is "Never hardcode colours." Yet: `text-emerald-400` ×17, `text-emerald-600` ×16, `bg-emerald-500` ×15, `bg-amber-500` ×10, `text-amber-600` ×8, `text-amber-400` ×8, `bg-sky-500` ×6, `text-rose-*` ×10, `text-violet-*` ×2, `text-red-500` ×2 — across 12 files including `app/layout/app-shell.tsx` itself (`:832`, `:844`) and `components/floating-actions.tsx:145`. Semantic equivalents (`--ok`, `--warn`, `--bad`, `--brand-blue`) exist for all of them. Every one breaks tenant white-labelling.

**48 inline `style={{…}}` blocks** bypass the system further, several re-specifying `background: var(--popover)` immediately after a `bg-popover` class (`app-shell.tsx:441`, `:531`).

**Page shells differ per area** — see F3's table. `const shell` is defined independently in 28 files rather than imported once.

**Interaction patterns differ for the same job:** Finance filters with `.chip` buttons (`finance/hub.tsx:245`), hubs filter with underlined tab buttons (`tabbed-hub.tsx:41`), the scaffold uses a third tab style (`screen-scaffold.tsx:62`). Row click navigates on some tables (`onRowClick`) and does nothing on others, with no visual cue distinguishing them.

**Iconography:** three icon systems (F6), plus emoji/text glyphs used as controls — `☰` (`app-shell.tsx:790`), `✕` (`:867`), `⚠` (`:880`), `✓`/`!` (`finance/hub.tsx:224`).

### F15 — Developer experience
**Severity: High · Structural**

How hard is it to build a new page consistently today? **Very** — and the evidence is that 24 feature areas each solved it differently.

| What's missing | Consequence |
|---|---|
| Working documented on-ramp (F5) | New dev imports a nonexistent component |
| `fontSize` / `spacing` tokens (F14) | 19 type sizes, arbitrary padding |
| Container width rule (F3) | 5 page widths, `shell` redefined 28× |
| Form abstraction (F4, F12) | Every form hand-rolls state, validation, error mapping |
| `Textarea`, `Checkbox`, `Radio`, `Tabs`, `Menu`, `Tooltip`, `Toast`, `Pagination` primitives | Re-invented inline or absent |
| **Any frontend test** | 0 client tests vs ~50 backend suites |
| `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` | A11y regressions ship silently |
| Component workbench (Storybook or equivalent) | No way to see a primitive's states |
| Usage examples per primitive | Docs describe two components that don't work |

`tsconfig.json` is strict (`strict`, `noUnusedLocals`, `noUnusedParameters`) — genuinely good. But `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` is `warn`, not `error`, and is suppressed 4 times; `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` is `off`.

**Doc drift is the compounding factor.** `doc/` holds 38+ markdown files including six overlapping frontend plans (`FE_DESIGN_RULES`, `FE_IA_HANDOFF`, `FE_IA_BUILD_MAP`, `FE_WIRING_PLAN`, `FRONTEND_PLAN`, `LOVABLE_FIDELITY_PLAN`, `UI_DEPTH_OVERHAUL_PLAN`). A new engineer cannot tell which is current — and the one that reads most authoritative is the one that's wrong.

---

### F16 — Tech stack gaps
**Severity: High · Structural**

Current client dependencies: `react`, `react-dom`, `react-router-dom`, `clsx`, `tailwind-merge`, `socket.io-client`, `topojson-client`, `world-atlas`. That is all. **No state library, no data layer, no form library, no test runner, no a11y tooling, no component primitives.**

Recommended additions, each justified by a finding above. All are compatible with the fixed React + Vite / Node foundation.

| Concern | Recommendation | Why — grounded in this audit |
|---|---|---|
| **Server state** | **TanStack Query v5** | F8: 9 concurrent unpaginated fetches per hub, zero caching, refetch on every mount. Query gives caching, dedup, background refresh and pagination with a near drop-in replacement for `useList`. Highest ROI of anything here. |
| **Accessible primitives** | **Radix UI** (Dialog, Tabs, DropdownMenu, Popover, Tooltip, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Select) | F13: focus trap, `role="menu"` keyboard semantics and tab semantics are exactly what Radix solves correctly. Headless + unstyled, so the existing token look is preserved. Do **not** adopt a styled kit — the visual system already exists. |
| **Forms + validation** | **React Hook Form + Zod**, with `@hookform/resolvers` | F4/F12: 569 fields with no validation wiring; backend already uses Zod. Create the `packages/shared` the README promises and share schemas FE↔BE — one definition of "valid". |
| **Client state** | **None — keep React context** | Deliberate: F7 found no prop-drilling problem. With server state moved to Query, the residual client state (auth, branding, theme) is small. Adding Zustand/Redux would be unjustified. |
| **Testing** | **Vitest + React Testing Library + jest-axe** | F15: zero frontend tests. Vitest shares the Vite config. `jest-axe` turns F13 into a regression gate rather than a one-off cleanup. |
| **E2E / visual** | **Playwright** | Already installed and configured in this environment. Needed to prove F2/F3 at 1280/1440/1920/2560 — desktop regressions are invisible to unit tests. |
| **A11y linting** | **`eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`** | F13: catches the 23 non-interactive `onClick`s and unassociated labels at author time. Add as `error` for new code. |
| **Tokens** | **Extend `tailwind.config.ts`** with `fontSize`, `spacing`, `screens` (add `xl`/`2xl` intent), `maxWidth` (named containers) | F2/F3/F14: the config currently extends colours only, which is precisely why type and width fragmented. |
| **Component workbench** | **Storybook** (or Ladle for a lighter footprint) | F15: satisfies the standing requirement for "usage examples for every new shared component". |
| **Bundle** | Route-level `React.lazy` | `vite.config.ts:90` already notes routes are eagerly imported and that lazy loading is "the follow-up". 62 routes in one entry bundle. |

Explicitly **not** recommended: a component library with opinionated styling (MUI/Chakra/Ant) — it would fight the existing token system; a CSS-in-JS runtime — Tailwind + tokens is working; a state management library — see above.

---

## 3. Remediation roadmap — 5 phases

**Sequencing rationale.** Foundation-first, not highest-traffic-first. F5 is the reason: the drift in this codebase is caused by a missing paved road, so fixing high-traffic pages before the road exists would produce a fourth dialect of the same components. The one exception is the Control Tower (F1), which is scheduled early in Phase 3 because it is the first screen every user sees and is the largest single-file liability.

Each phase is independently shippable and leaves the app in a working state.

---

### Phase 1 — Foundation: tokens, containers, and the desktop breakpoint

**Objective.** Establish the design contract the rest of the work depends on: a type scale, a spacing scale, named container widths, real desktop breakpoints, and a token layer that passes WCAG AA.

**Scope**
- Extend `tailwind.config.ts`: `fontSize`, `spacing`, `maxWidth` (named containers), explicit `screens` including `xl`/`2xl`.
- Retune failing tokens in `index.css`: `--ink-3` (F13 — `.micro` at 3.01:1), `--ok`, `--warn`, and the `--primary`-as-text case. Preserve brand hue; adjust lightness to clear 4.5:1 in both themes. Add `.st-info` (F12).
- Add `:focus-visible` rules for `.chip`, `.lux-navlink`, `.lux-botnav-btn` (F13).
- Introduce `<PageContainer variant="wide|standard|reading">` and adopt it in `<main>` (`app-shell.tsx:890`), replacing the 86 `max-w-6xl` literals and the 28 local `const shell`s.
- Install and configure: `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`, Vitest + RTL + jest-axe, Playwright desktop viewport project.
- Retire `doc/FE_DESIGN_RULES.md`'s false claims (F5); mark superseded frontend docs.

**Pages/components touched.** `tailwind.config.ts`, `index.css`, `eslint.config.js`, new `components/layout/page-container.tsx`, mechanical sweep across all 86 `max-w-6xl` sites.

**Dependencies.** None — this is the root.

**Deliverables.** Token reference table (documented values + measured contrast ratios); `PageContainer` with usage examples; green a11y lint baseline; CI running lint + typecheck + tests.

**Validation.** Automated contrast assertion over every token pair in the test suite (the table in F13 becomes a test). Playwright screenshots at 1280/1440/1920/2560 before-and-after. `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` passing at `warn`, with a documented path to `error`. Manual keyboard pass over top nav and chips.

---

### Phase 2 — The paved road: primitives, forms, and data layer

**Objective.** Make the correct way to build a screen the easy way. This phase produces the on-ramp F5 promised and never delivered.

**Scope**
- **Primitives on Radix**, styled with Phase 1 tokens: `Dialog` (replacing `Modal` — adds focus trap + restore, F13), `Tabs` (replacing `tabbed-hub`'s div/button bar and the scaffold's third variant), `DropdownMenu` (replacing the three `role="menu"` hand-rolls), `Tooltip`, `Checkbox`, `RadioGroup`, `Select`.
- **New primitives:** `Textarea` (F6 — currently 3 local class constants), `Toast`, `Pagination`, `ErrorBoundary` (F12), `EmptyState` with an `action` slot (F11).
- **Fix `Field`** (F4): `useId`-based label association, `aria-required`, `aria-invalid`, `aria-describedby` wiring. One component, 569 sites fixed.
- **`<Form>` on React Hook Form + Zod**, with a `packages/shared` schema package shared with the backend (F12, F16).
- **TanStack Query** replacing `useList`/`useResource`, with a compatibility shim so pages migrate incrementally (F8).
- **Delete or revive dead code:** `components/ui/card.tsx` (0 importers), `components/resource-list.tsx` (0 call sites). Recommend reviving `Card` as the single card surface and deleting `ResourceList`.
- **Consolidate duplicates** (F6): one `errMsg`, one `money`, one icon set, one table.
- **Fix the `errMsg` double-wrap defect** at all 16 sites (F12).
- **`<ListPage>` scaffold** — the composition of container + header + toolbar + `DataList` + states that every list screen currently rebuilds.

**Pages/components touched.** All of `components/ui/*`, `components/data-list.tsx`, `components/tabbed-hub.tsx`, `lib/use-resource.ts`, `lib/format.ts`, new `packages/shared`.

**Dependencies.** Phase 1 (tokens, container, test infra).

**Deliverables.** Storybook with every primitive, all states (default/hover/focus/disabled/loading/error), light + dark. A usage example and a short best-practices note per primitive. A **"Build a new screen" guide** that is verified by a test asserting the example compiles and renders.

**Validation.** jest-axe on every primitive story. Keyboard-only walkthrough of Dialog, Tabs, DropdownMenu, Select against the WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices. Contract tests for `Field` label association. Screen-reader spot-check (NVDA or VoiceOver) on one representative form.

---

### Phase 3 — Control Tower and the high-traffic core

**Objective.** Convert the app's most-used surfaces onto the paved road, starting with the iframe.

**Scope**
- **Rebuild the Control Tower in React** (F1). Port the KPI cards, drill-down modals, live-shipment list and world map into components fed by TanStack Query. Delete `features/dashboard-mock/*` (1,440 lines) and the `postMessage` bridge. This is the phase's largest item and its main risk — the visual design is genuinely good and must be preserved exactly.
- **Restructure the top-level navigation** (F9): surface all 16 areas on desktop via a proper menubar, keeping the overlay drawer for `< md` only.
- Migrate **Finance** (`hub.tsx`, `pages.tsx` — 2,877 lines) and **Operations** onto `ListPage`, `Form`, and Query; split the god files by screen (F7).
- Add the **skip link** and fix page `<h1>` structure in `PageHeader` (F13).

**Pages/components touched.** `features/dashboard.tsx`, `features/dashboard-mock/*` (deleted), `app/layout/app-shell.tsx`, `features/finance/*`, `features/operations/*`, `components/data-list.tsx`.

**Dependencies.** Phases 1–2.

**Deliverables.** Control Tower as ~10 tested components with no iframe. Desktop navigation reaching all 16 areas without an overlay. Finance and Operations decomposed to one screen per file.

**Validation.** Side-by-side visual diff of old iframe vs new Control Tower at four desktop widths (Playwright). Axe scan of the dashboard — previously impossible through the iframe boundary. Tenant white-label smoke test: change `--primary`, confirm the Control Tower re-tints (it cannot today). Query devtools review confirming request count drops from 9 to a cached set.

---

### Phase 4 — Breadth: the remaining 80 screens

**Objective.** Bring every remaining screen to the same standard, area by area.

**Scope.** In descending order of size and traffic: **Sales** (2,591 lines), **Settings** (`config-pages` 1,137 + `store-pages` 609 + `master-data-pages` 601), **Security** (1,061), **Vault** (1,052), **Commercial** (1,035), **Governance** (938), **Master data** (733 + 691), **HR** (12 screens), **WMS** (6), **Fleet** (7), **Procurement**, **Costing**, **Comms**, **AI Control**, **Portal**, **Workspace**, **Support**, **Help**, **God mode**.

Per screen, a fixed checklist:
1. `PageContainer` with a deliberate width variant.
2. Desktop-tier layout — real `xl:`/`2xl:` behaviour, not a frozen `sm:` grid.
3. All four states explicit: loading (`PageSkeleton`/`SkeletonTable`), empty (with action), error, success.
4. Forms on `Form` + shared Zod schema, with field-level errors.
5. Raw palette colours → semantic tokens (F14 — 122 sites).
6. Raw `<table>`/`<input>`/`<textarea>`/`<button>` → primitives.
7. Non-interactive `onClick` → real controls (F13 — 23 sites).
8. Axe clean.

**Pages/components touched.** All remaining `features/*`.

**Dependencies.** Phases 1–3. Independent per area, so this phase parallelises across engineers — the main reason for sequencing it after the road exists.

**Deliverables.** All 96 screens on shared primitives. God files decomposed. Zero raw-palette colours. Route-level `React.lazy` (F16).

**Validation.** Per-area a11y gate (axe, zero violations). Playwright desktop screenshots per screen at 1440 and 1920. A tracked checklist so partial completion is visible rather than assumed. Bundle-size report confirming the lazy-loading win.

---

### Phase 5 — Density, polish, and regression-proofing

**Objective.** Move from "correct and consistent" to "deliberately engineered" — and make it stay that way.

**Scope**
- **Information density** (F9): a compact table variant, user-selectable row density, sticky headers and frozen first columns for wide financial tables, column visibility controls.
- **Desktop-native interactions** the app currently lacks: multi-select with shift-click, bulk row actions, keyboard row navigation, inline edit where it fits, resizable split panes for master-detail screens.
- **Retire the draggable FAB** on desktop (F9) in favour of a fixed, non-overlapping entry point; keep it for touch.
- **Motion and reduced-motion** review across the now-consistent surfaces.
- **AAA where it pays** (F13): 7:1 for body text, status pills and money figures.
- **Regression-proofing:** `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` from `warn` to `error`; contrast assertions in CI; visual regression baselines; a "new screen" generator that scaffolds the checklist from Phase 4.
- Consolidate the six overlapping frontend docs into one maintained guide (F15).

**Pages/components touched.** `components/ui/table.tsx`, `data-list.tsx`, high-density screens (Finance, Operations, WMS, Security matrix), CI config, `doc/`.

**Dependencies.** Phase 4 — density work is only safe once every table uses the shared component.

**Deliverables.** Density system with usage guidance. Desktop interaction patterns documented. CI gates that fail on contrast, a11y and visual regressions. One canonical frontend guide.

**Validation.** Full WCAG 2.1 AA audit against the 96-screen inventory, with AAA noted where achieved. Operator usability session on the densest screens (Finance invoice list, Security permission matrix) at 1920px. CI proven to catch a deliberately introduced regression of each gated class.

---

## 4. Appendix — measured baseline

Metrics to re-measure at each phase gate.

| Metric | Today | Target |
|---|---|---|
| `xl:` / `2xl:` breakpoint uses | **0 / 0** | Desktop tiers on every layout screen |
| `mx-auto max-w-6xl` literals | **86** | 0 (via `PageContainer`) |
| Distinct page container widths | 5, unruled | 3, named + documented |
| `<Field>` sites with label association | **0 / 569** | 569 / 569 |
| `aria-invalid` / `aria-describedby` / `aria-required` | **0 / 0 / 0** | Wired in `Field` |
| Pages with an `<h1>` | ~9 / 117 | 117 / 117 |
| Token contrast failures (measured) | **6** | 0 |
| Raw Tailwind palette colours | **122** | 0 |
| Distinct font sizes | **19** | ~8 (scale) |
| `errMsg` implementations | **6** | 1 |
| `money` implementations | **5** | 1 |
| Card surface recipes | **4+** | 1 |
| Dead primitives (0 importers) | `ui/card.tsx`, `resource-list.tsx` | 0 |
| Files > 400 lines | **17** | 0 |
| Ad-hoc `Loading…` strings | **28** | 0 |
| Screens with no empty state | **11** | 0 |
| `onClick` on non-interactive elements | **23** | 0 |
| `role="menu"` without keyboard nav | **3** | 0 |
| Frontend tests | **0** | Per-primitive + per-area |
| Error boundaries | **0** | App + per-route |
| Documented components that exist | **0 / 2** | 2 / 2 |

---

## 5. Open questions for review

Answers change Phase 1 scope, so these are worth settling before implementation starts.

1. **Minimum supported desktop width** — is 1280px the floor, or must 1024px laptops be first-class? Determines whether `lg:` or `xl:` is the primary desktop tier.
2. **Brand colour latitude** — `--primary` orange fails AA as text at 2.59:1. May the *text* usage be darkened (keeping fills and the brand mark exactly as-is), or is the hex immovable? There is a clean solution either way, but it changes the token structure.
3. **Control Tower fidelity** — should the React rebuild be pixel-identical to the current mock, or is Phase 3 the moment to revisit its desktop layout (which is frozen above 1180px)?
4. **`platform-console/`** — in or out of the design system? It currently shares nothing with the tenant app.
5. **Density defaults** — should tables default to compact for operators, with comfortable as an opt-in? Affects Phase 5 scope and the Phase 1 spacing scale.

---

**Status: Phase 0 complete. Awaiting review and approval before any implementation.**

# Addendum — full per-screen read (2026-08-04, same day)

The findings above were produced from ~15 files read in full plus tree-wide
measurement. That is sound for counts and contrast, but it is not the
exhaustive per-screen review the brief asked for. Every remaining feature file
has now been read. **Four conclusions changed. Nothing above is retracted, but
two findings were materially wrong in emphasis.**

## A1 — CORRECTION: the codebase is bimodal, not uniformly inconsistent

This is the most important correction in the audit, because it changes the
remediation cost by roughly an order of magnitude.

There are **two parallel frontend architectures**, and they split cleanly:

**Branch A — canonical (46 files).** Built on `lib/use-resource` + `Pill`
(tokens) + `DataList` + `Modal`/`Field`. Covers **all of HR (12), WMS (7),
Fleet (7), Procurement, Governance, Security, Masterdata, Costing, AI Control,
Comms, Godmode, Support, Workspace**, and the Finance sub-pages
(`receivables`, `debt`, `chart-of-accounts`, `hub`).

**Branch B — shadow (11 files).** Built on `features/sales/ui.tsx`. Covers
**Sales, Commercial, Vault pages, Settings (×3), Portal pages,
`finance/pages.tsx`, and `dashboard.tsx`**.

`features/operations/pages.tsx` imports from **both** — it is the seam.

Branch A is genuinely good work: purpose-built workstations (payroll run,
recruitment kanban, vehicle 360, inventory ledger, contract lifecycle) rather
than CRUD tables, with consistent states and token-based status. `Pill` is
imported by **45** files; the raw-hex `Badge` by **4**. The token system won.
The shadow branch is a minority holdout.

**Implication:** the remediation is not "rewrite the frontend." It is
"finish migrating 11 files off `features/sales/ui.tsx` and delete it."

## A2 — NEW (Critical): `features/sales/ui.tsx` is a shadow design system

332 lines in a *feature folder*, imported by **10 other feature areas**
(`finance/pages`, `vault/pages`, `commercial/pages`, `settings/store-pages`,
`settings/catalogue-page`, `settings/config-pages`, `operations/pages`,
`dashboard`, `portal/pages`, `sales/pages`). It ships competing copies of the
app's core abstractions:

| Export | Conflicts with | Nature of conflict |
|---|---|---|
| `useList(path, nonce, enabled)` | `lib/use-resource.useList(path)` | **Incompatible signature.** Two data hooks, no `loading` flag on this one. |
| `errMsg` | `lib/use-resource.errMsg` | Duplicate #2 of 6 |
| `fmtMoney` | `lib/format.money` | Different locale + currency defaults |
| `Badge` | `ui/pill.Pill` | **A complete parallel status system** — a 27-entry hardcoded raw-Tailwind map (`bg-sky-500/10 text-sky-600 dark:text-sky-400`, …) at `ui.tsx:63-90` |
| `Segmented`, `Chips`, `Avatar`, `MetricTile`, `SearchSelect` | — | Only implementations, but wrongly located |

`Badge`'s colour map is **the single largest source of the 122 raw-palette
violations in F14** — it is not scatter, it is one table. Deleting this file
resolves, in one move: the second data hook, the second error helper, the
second money formatter, the second status system, most raw-colour violations,
and all cross-feature coupling (F7).

`features/settings/config-pages.tsx:23-45` inlines a **fourth** copy of the
same mini-library (`errMsg`, `cell`, `fmtDate`, `useList`) while *also*
importing `SearchSelect` from the shadow lib.

## A3 — NEW (High): local re-implementations found only by reading

grep found the duplication counts; reading found what they are.

| Component | Copies | Locations |
|---|---|---|
| `Segmented` | **4** | `components/settings/controls.tsx:121` (exported, unused), `features/sales/ui.tsx:98`, `features/governance/pages.tsx:27`, `features/security/pages.tsx:93` |
| `Panel` | **5** | `workspace-page.tsx:29`, `vault/hub.tsx:44`, `security/hub.tsx:52`, `portal-app.tsx:233`, + `finance/hub.tsx` (`AgeingPanel`/`CashPanel`) |
| `Stat` | **3** | `master/pages.tsx:234`, `operations/pages.tsx:188`, `fleet/fuel.tsx:21` |
| `FormButtons` | **3** | `operations/pages.tsx:56`, `procurement/pages.tsx:36`, `masterdata/pages.tsx:25` |
| Table impl | **4** | `ui/table.tsx`, `ui/workflow.tsx:888` (`LineTable`), `fleet/vehicle.tsx:40` (`MiniTable` + local `Th`/`Td`), 12 raw `<table>` |

`features/security/pages.tsx:92` carries the comment *"Small local segmented
control (sales/ui.tsx's is scoped to that feature)"* — the duplication is
known and was accepted rather than resolved, because there was no shared home
to put it in (F5 again).

## A4 — NEW (High): raw JSON shown to end users

Three screens dump unformatted JSON into the UI when a payload does not match
an expected shape:

- `features/vault/pages.tsx:61` — `<pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>`
  is the **fallback renderer for every catalogue report**. A report returning
  a non-array shape shows the customer raw JSON.
- `features/portal/pages.tsx:200` — same, on the **external client portal**.
  This is the surface a tenant's own customers see.
- `features/governance/pages.tsx:118` — audit-ledger values.

`vault/pages.tsx:32-60` also infers report table columns via `Object.keys()`,
so column headers are raw database field names (`total_ttc`, `client_id`).

## A5 — Credit where it is due

Reading changed my view of the engineering, and the audit above was unfair on
this point by omission.

- **Branch A screens are well-designed products**, not scaffolds. `hr/payroll.tsx`
  models a real segregation-of-duties ladder (OPEN → Compute → Submit → Approve →
  Validate/post-GL → Disburse) with the Cameroon statutory breakdown. `wms/inventory.tsx`
  is a proper stock ledger with an append-only movement journal.
- **`features/security/permission-matrix-page.tsx:1-35`** is the best file in the
  codebase. Its header documents why the matrix was transposed (density: 70 modules ×
  5 letter-buttons = 350+ hit targets), why the popover is `fixed` not `absolute`
  (sticky columns in a scroll container would clip it), and **two features
  deliberately not built** because they would imply grants that don't exist. That is
  senior-level design reasoning.
- **Comment quality throughout is unusually high** — `dashboard.tsx:60-78` documents
  three specific defects it fixed and why each was wrong; `app.tsx:56-68` explains an
  auth-boundary routing decision rather than trusting route-ranking. Most codebases at
  this stage have no such record.

The problem here is **not** engineering judgment. It is that good judgment was
applied without a shared foundation to apply it to — so it produced 24 locally
sound solutions to the same problems (F5).

## A6 — Revised remediation impact

Phase 2 gains one high-leverage, well-bounded task that should run first:

> **Delete `features/sales/ui.tsx`.** Migrate its 11 consumers to `lib/use-resource`,
> `Pill`, `lib/format`, and relocate `SearchSelect`/`Chips`/`Avatar`/`MetricTile`
> into `components/ui/`. Resolves A2 entirely and the bulk of F6, F14 and the
> cross-feature coupling in F7.

Estimated at 3–5 days, and it converts the codebase from two architectures to one
before any other refactor is attempted.

**Coverage statement:** every file under `client/src/features/` and
`client/src/components/` has now been read. `platform-console/` remains out of scope.

# Addendum 2 — Aesthetics (the section the first pass avoided)

The original audit said the blockers were "specific rather than aesthetic."
That was a hedge, and it was the wrong call. Aesthetics is not a softer
category than accessibility — it is the one a buyer judges **first**, in the
first fifteen seconds of a demo, before anyone opens a VPAT or asks about test
coverage. It deserved a finding of its own. Here it is.

## F17 — The visual language is a well-executed template, and it reads as one

**Severity: High (commercially: Critical) · Structural, but the cheapest fix in this audit**

### The core diagnosis

`index.css:6-12` and `doc/LOVABLE_FIDELITY_PLAN.md` name the source honestly:
the look is the **"Lovable Control Tower"** mock, ported. That provenance is
legible in the output, and it is the whole problem. AI app-builders (Lovable,
v0, bolt) share a recognisable house style, and this codebase implements it
faithfully:

| Trait | Where | What it signals |
|---|---|---|
| Full-page gradient mesh | `index.css:154-166` — fixed, `blur(30px)`, opacity 0.5/0.7 | Marketing page |
| Glassmorphic bars | `.lux-topbar`, `.lux-botnav` — `blur(20px) saturate(150%)` | 2020–21 Big Sur trend |
| Large radii | `--radius: 0.9rem` = **14.4px** cards | Consumer app |
| Coloured glow shadows | `.btn-primary` — `0 8px 20px color-mix(--primary 35%)` | Dribbble shot |
| Hover lift micro-interactions | `translateY(-1px)` on chips/buttons ×5, `hover:scale-105` ×3 | Landing page |
| Display serif + geometric sans | Playfair Display + Montserrat | Boutique / editorial |
| 500ms entrance animation | `.animate-fade-up` on every card and table | Portfolio site |

Individually each is defensible. Together they are a **coherent aesthetic
aimed at the wrong category.** Every one of these choices optimises for *how
the product photographs* rather than *how it feels on the 300th use*. That is
exactly the trade a system of record must not make.

### The typography is the single worst call

`--font-display: "Playfair Display"` is a **high-contrast Didone** — an
editorial and fashion display face. It is applied at 35 sites: every page
`<h1>`, every modal title, every card `<h3>`… **and on money figures.**

```
client/src/features/finance/hub.tsx:232-233
  <div className="num font-display text-lg">{money(t?.debit)}</div>   // Total débit
  <div className="num font-display text-lg">{money(t?.credit)}</div>  // Total crédit
```

Setting a trial-balance total in a Didone serif is not a stylistic preference
I disagree with — it is wrong for the job. Didone hairlines break up at small
sizes, and the face carries luxury/editorial connotations. An audited ledger
figure should read as *precise*, not *elegant*.

Compounding it: **Playfair Display + Montserrat is arguably the most-used
Google Fonts pairing on the internet** — the default Canva/Squarespace/
wedding-invitation combination. To anyone who evaluates interfaces for a
living, it is an instant tell.

What the benchmark actually ships:

| Product | UI typeface |
|---|---|
| Palantir (Blueprint) | Inter |
| Microsoft (Fluent) | Segoe UI |
| Google (Material 3) | Roboto / Google Sans |
| Stripe Dashboard | Söhne (custom) |
| Linear | Inter Display |
| Vercel | Geist |

**Not one serious enterprise data product uses a display serif for UI.** There
is no counter-example to point at.

### Density: you are showing 40% less data than the category standard

`ui/table.tsx:755` sets `TD` to `px-4 py-3.5` — 14px top + 14px bottom against
a 13px/18px line, giving **~46px rows**. Palantir-, Bloomberg- and
Retool-class grids run **28–32px**.

For a logistics operator scanning 200 open shipments, that is the difference
between one screen and three. Density is not austerity in this category — it
is the product. And there is no compact variant to switch to (F9).

Meanwhile the *labels* are too small in the other direction: `TH` at **9.5px**
and `.micro` at **10px**, both uppercase with 0.14–0.19em tracking. Heavy
tracking on tiny uppercase is an editorial device; here it costs legibility
and drives the contrast failures measured in F13. The type is simultaneously
too large where data lives and too small where labels live.

### Motion is tuned for a portfolio, not a workstation

`.animate-fade-up` — `translateY(12px) → 0` over **0.5s** — fires on every
card, table and view mount (`ui/table.tsx:728`, `data-list.tsx:116`). A
dispatcher who opens the shipments table forty times a day waits half a second,
forty times, for a decoration.

Linear's entire brand proposition is sub-100ms response. The enterprise
convention is 120–180ms for entrances, or none at all. 500ms reads as slow
software even when the data arrived instantly — it actively disguises good
backend performance as bad.

### Colour: a semantic collision and a dated dark mode

- **Orange as primary is a semantic conflict.** `--primary` is `#F5821F`;
  `--warn` is amber `rgb(176 128 24)`. The colour that means "confirm this
  action" and the colour that means "something is wrong" sit ~30° apart on the
  wheel. In a ledger application that is a genuine comprehension risk, not a
  taste question. It is also unusable as text at **2.59:1** (F13).
- **Dark mode is navy, not neutral.** `--background: rgb(7 19 36)` is a
  strongly blue-tinted dark. The category standard is near-neutral
  (Linear `#08090a`, Vercel `#000`, Palantir near-black). Navy darks read
  "crypto dashboard / gamer" rather than "instrument."
- **The mesh gradient sits behind every data screen**, lowering effective
  contrast everywhere — measurably so: `.micro` is 3.01:1 on `--card` but
  **2.78:1** on the meshed `--background`. Stripe uses mesh gradients on
  marketing pages and never behind a table.

### NEW — the PWA loses its typography offline

`index.html:19-24` loads both families from `fonts.googleapis.com`.
`vite.config.ts:36` globs `**/*.{js,css,html,svg,woff2}` — **local** assets
only — and there is no `runtimeCaching` rule for the font CDN.

So the offline mode this product advertises (logistics, ports, thin
connectivity) falls back to **Georgia + system sans**. Offline, the app is
visually a different product. It also blocks first render on a third-party
request, and pulls **11 weights** (4 Playfair + 7 Montserrat) when far fewer
are used.

### What is genuinely good — and it is not nothing

The *information design* instincts here are better than the styling, which is
the far better problem to have:

- **Token architecture is properly semantic** and tenant-overridable at
  runtime. Most teams never get this right.
- **`.num` tabular figures on all money** (`index.css:175`) — correct,
  and frequently missed even by good teams.
- **Enum humanisation** — `POSTED_LOCKED` → "Posted locked" (`ui/pill.tsx:605`).
  Real polish; the reference mock did not do this.
- **The status-pill system** (dot + tinted ground) is clean and scales.
- **Light and dark are both genuinely designed**, not a filter.
- **The Control Tower's information design** — KPI band, live shipments with
  progress, route map, drill-downs — is a legitimately good dashboard concept.
  It is housed badly (F1); the thinking is sound.
- **The permission matrix** (`security/permission-matrix-page.tsx`) is the best
  *design* work in the repo, not just the best code.

### Honest verdict

Against Palantir / Microsoft / Google / Oracle: **the aesthetics would not
stand.** Not because they are ugly — they are attractive — but because they are
*generic and mis-categorised*. It looks like a beautiful template, and
enterprise buyers have been trained by a decade of SaaS to distrust exactly
that surface. The gap is not craft; it is that the whole visual system points
at "premium consumer app" when the product is an instrument.

### The remedy is a token pass — the cheapest item in this audit

Nothing here requires re-architecture. Every change is confined to
`index.css`, `tailwind.config.ts`, `index.html` and `ui/table.tsx`:

| Change | From | To |
|---|---|---|
| Display face | Playfair Display | Inter Display / Geist — **self-hosted** |
| Body face | Montserrat (7 weights, CDN) | Inter — self-hosted, 3–4 weights |
| Card radius | 14.4px | 8px (controls 6px) |
| Button shadow | Coloured glow | 1px border + near-flat |
| Hover lift | `translateY(-1px)` / `scale(1.05)` | Background/border state change |
| Top bar | `blur(20px) saturate(150%)` | Solid, 1px bottom border |
| Page background | Fixed mesh gradient | Flat surface token |
| Entrance motion | 500ms fade-up | 120ms opacity, or none |
| Table row | ~46px | 32px default, 28px compact |
| Label type | 9.5–10px, 0.19em tracking | 11–12px, ~0.02em |
| Dark base | `rgb(7 19 36)` navy | Near-neutral `rgb(10 11 13)`-class |
| Primary accent | Orange (collides with `--warn`) | Blue-family primary; retain orange as brand mark only |

**Estimated 1–2 weeks**, and it moves perceived tier further than any other
item on the five-phase roadmap. It should run **inside Phase 1**, alongside the
contrast retune it partly resolves anyway — the two touch the same tokens.

One caveat worth stating plainly: the orange is presumably a brand asset, and
demoting it from UI primary to brand-mark-only is a business decision, not an
engineering one. That is question 2 in §5, and it needs an owner's answer.
