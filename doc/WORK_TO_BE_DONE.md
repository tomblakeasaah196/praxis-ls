# Praxis LS — Work To Be Done

Derived from the PRD (Master Functional Spec v2) and the kickoff meeting. Organised by delivery phase, per the accounting-first roadmap (no big-bang cutover). Update statuses as work lands; this file is the running backlog, not a historical record — the transcript/PRD stay unchanged as source of truth.

## Session 16 status — 2026-07-29

**Landed** (detail in `doc/WORK_DONE.md` / `doc/SESSION_HANDOFF.md`): document-UI overhaul finished (native
`DocumentPage` + `<DocButton>` across all doc types with real loaders); logo fix (base64 inline + branding
fallback); contract signed-copy flow (send-on-create + upload/replace signed → `pdf_vault_id`); Send PDF
attachment + recipient resolution (master emails, `0475`); document line items (`0476`); DSF SYSCOHADA build;
AI vendor keys migrated to the platform (shared, deploy-wide — `platform/0060`, console **Integrations → AI
providers**, tenant Vendors tab removed); AI Control menu hidden for AI-off tenants; clock-in/favicon/nav fixes.

**Also landed (late):** doc-numbering display fix (lists read the real `doc_number`/`ot_number`, not the
unpopulated `ref`); line items locked to catalogue selects (PO/PR → financial dictionary, GRN/delivery/transit
→ inventory) via `catalogue-select.tsx` + `0477_line_item_refs` FK columns.

**Cleared 2026-08-01 (user-run on Windows):** migrations applied (platform `0060_ai_vendor`, tenant
`0475_master_email` + `0476_document_lines` + `0477_line_item_refs`) and **`npm run lint` / `npm test` /
`npm run build` all pass clean**. Those four lines are done; do not re-raise them.

**Remaining / owed:**

- Seed the **financial-dictionary** + **inventory** masters so the new line-item selects have options.
- **DSF pixel-exact** — still a structured summary; needs the official DGI liasse PDF to match exactly.

## ✅ TEST-MODE WRITES WERE BROKEN SINCE SESSION 3 — fully closed 2026-08-02 (kept for the reasoning)

**The single most important finding of session 17.** Read this before touching anything that writes an
actor id.

**The collision.** Session 3 pinned identity to the LIVE schema (`req.identityDb`) so the LIVE/TEST toggle
would stop logging people out. Business data still writes through `req.tenantDb`, which under TEST is the
**sandbox** schema. But **60+ columns across the tenant schema are typed `REFERENCES app_user(user_id)`** —
`issued_by`, `validated_by`, `approved_by`, `requested_by`, `received_by`, `counted_by`, `moved_by`,
`rated_by`, `owner_user_id`, `holder_user_id`, `attested_by`, `completed_by`, `actor_user_id`, `deleted_by`…

So a perfectly valid live user id, stored beside sandbox business data, raises **23503** — surfacing as
_"Referenced record not found"_, usually AFTER the business row had already committed (most services have no
surrounding transaction). The user sees a record that exists and an error saying it doesn't, then a
duplicate-key error if they retry.

**Why nobody noticed for fourteen sessions.** `sandbox.app_user` still held the rows copied at original
provisioning. The bug only appears once a sandbox has been **wiped** — `wipeSandbox` does
`DROP SCHEMA sandbox CASCADE` and no `90*` seed creates users. The first wipe made every TEST-mode write fail.

**Fixed** by mirroring `live.app_user` into the rebuilt sandbox at the end of `wipeSandbox`
(`provisioning.service.js`). One change, all 60+ columns, and attribution stays REAL rather than silently
NULL — so maker-checker (`soft_delete.restored_by <> deleted_by`) still means something. Not a security
widening: auth, sessions and RBAC all resolve against `req.identityDb`, so these rows are FK targets, not
credentials. Guarding each call site was tried first and abandoned — the tail is dozens of columns long and
**every new module reintroduces it**.

Kept alongside, because they're correct independently: `emitEvent` / `audit` / `soft_delete.deleted_by` now
write the actor via a guarded sub-select, and `shared/events/emit.js` exports **`resolveActorId(client, id)`**
for per-module actor columns. An audit write should never fail over attribution.

**✅ CLOSED 2026-08-02 (session 18) — and it was two holes, not one.**

The session-17 fix mirrored at **wipe time only**, which left:

1. **Newly provisioned tenants.** Provisioning creates the schemas _before_ `create-admin.js` makes any user,
   so there is nothing to copy at that point and a brand-new tenant's sandbox starts empty. Their first
   TEST-mode write failed exactly as described above — and the remedy (wipe the sandbox) is deeply
   unintuitive for something that reads like a permissions error.
2. **Drift on an established tenant** — _not previously identified_. The wipe mirror is a point-in-time
   snapshot, so **every user created after the last wipe was equally missing**. A hire onboarded months later
   would hit the identical 23503 on a system that had worked fine for everyone else. Confirmed real: the
   backfill found **2 such users on smartls**.

Both close at the source — mirroring now runs on user **create/update**, not only on wipe:

- `src/shared/db/sandbox-user-mirror.js` — `mirrorUsersIntoSandbox(client, {userId})` (throws) and
  `mirrorUserBestEffort(client, userId)` (swallows + warns, for the request path). Schemas named explicitly
  rather than trusting `search_path`; `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` deliberately **untargeted**, so it absorbs an
  `email` clash as well as a `user_id` one; the single-user path verifies afterwards and warns, since an email
  collision is the one case where "nothing inserted" still leaves the FK unsatisfied.
- Called from `provisioning.wipeSandbox` (as before), `provisioning.createAdmin`,
  `scripts/tenant/create-admin.js`, and `app_user.service` `createUser` (after COMMIT, best-effort — a sandbox
  problem must never fail a live user create) + `updateUser` (self-heal for pre-fix users, not a sync).
- `scripts/tenant/mirror-users.js --slug=<x> | --all [--dry-run]` backfills existing tenants. Idempotent.
  Reports anything it could not mirror rather than claiming success.
- **Runs on deploy** — `migrateTenant()` mirrors after `projectFeatures()`, and `scripts/deploy.sh`'s migrate
  service covers platform + all tenants on every deploy, so no environment depends on someone remembering the
  script. Best-effort (a deploy must not fail over this); failures log at error level.
- `tests/unit/sandbox-user-mirror.test.js`.

**Verified 2026-08-02 (user-run on Windows):** lint/test clean; `--all` reported `smartls: mirrored 2 of 2
missing user(s)`; a TEST-mode write with a real actor confirmed working in the UI.

## ✅ ONBOARDING GAP — CLOSED 2026-08-01 (kept for the reasoning)

Surfaced while planning a fresh end-to-end walkthrough (create prerequisites → create a dossier) against a
clean environment. **It could not be completed**, and not because of anything recent — three pieces have no
create path in the application at all:

| Thing                                | Backend                                 | UI                     |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Corporate entity                     | ✅                                      | ✅                     |
| Client                               | ✅                                      | ✅                     |
| **Service type**                     | ❌ **no module exists**                 | ❌                     |
| **Milestone template**               | ✅ `POST /milestones/templates`         | ❌ read-only list only |
| **Service type on the dossier form** | ✅ validator + `DossierInput` accept it | ❌ never sent          |
| Dossier                              | ✅                                      | ✅                     |

`service_type` is referenced by ten modules but **has no module of its own** — no repo/service/controller/
routes, so there is no `/service-types` endpoint. The only thing that has ever created one is
`scripts/tenant/seed-sandbox.sql`. No `9xxx` seed creates service types, milestone templates or corporate
entities, so a freshly provisioned tenant has none of them.

**This contradicts a stated design intent.** `0310_operations.sql:7`:

```sql
-- Services as DATA, not code (transcript §11.3). User-creatable, with applicability.
```

**Why it matters more than it looks.** Service types are load-bearing: milestone templates hang off them,
`dictionary_item.service_type_key` references them, and they drive the operations taxonomy and the Control
Tower map's transport mode. And a forwarder's milestone chain **is** their operating procedure — shipping the
sandbox seed's five sea-freight stages to every tenant means shipping one company's process as everyone's.

**Consequences today:** onboarding a tenant requires an engineer with database access to insert rows, every
time — which does not scale, makes trials expensive, and grows support load linearly with sales. Phase 5's
"Root Admin marks tenant Live" quietly assumes the tenant can be configured first; it cannot. Because
milestone auto-seeding (session 17) reads the service type's active template, a dossier created through the UI
also comes out with no milestone chain — the two gaps compound.

**CLOSED — built 2026-08-01** after the operations lane agreed to do it properly rather than work around it:

- `src/modules/operations/service_type/` — full module on the shared CRUD kit, `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE
/service-types`, feature-gated `operations`, riding **MOD-29** (a module_key absent from the catalogue has
  grants for nobody and would 403 every non-CEO user). `key` is immutable after creation —
  `dictionary_item.service_type_key` references it, so a rename would orphan silently. DELETE **archives**;
  `dossier.service_type_id` is a plain FK with no ON DELETE, so a real delete would either fail the
  constraint or strip the classification off historical dossiers.
- `client/src/features/operations/service-types.tsx` — the screen, **with the milestone-template editor on
  it**. `POST /milestones/templates` had existed with nothing calling it. The two are together on purpose: a
  service type with no active template silently yields dossiers with no chain, so the list shows a warn pill
  for that state and the fix is one click away. Sea/Air/Transit presets are a starting point, not a default —
  every stage stays editable, because a forwarder's milestone chain IS their operating procedure.
- **Service-type field added to the dossier form.** Without it none of the above reached a dossier: every
  UI-created dossier had `service_type_id = null`, so milestones could never auto-seed and the map fell back
  to guessing transport mode from text.

Verified end to end on a wiped sandbox: service type → milestone template → corporate entity → client →
dossier, with the dossier arriving with a live milestone chain, a progress bar and a plotted map lane, and
nothing touching the database directly.

## Session 17 status — 2026-08-01

**Landed** (detail in `doc/WORK_DONE.md`): the Control Tower map made real (`0478_geo_place` +
`0479_dossier_place_refs`, Geoapify forward geocoding, Natural Earth basemap, POL/POD pickers, save-time
resolution); the live-shipments panel fixed (route keys, ISO dates, hardcoded 45% progress bars, enum casing,
service-type-driven mode); the **`/media` auth bypass** closed; branding moved to live-base/sandbox-override;
milestone **auto-seeding** on dossier create + air/transit templates + chains on all seed dossiers; **AI
conversation memory**; CI gained dependency/secret scanning, a migration-number guard and a frontend build job.

**Bugs found and fixed in passing:** `advanceMilestone` never sent the required `to` (every UI advance was
422ing); AI action runs recorded a `conversation_id` the copilot never sent (all orphaned); the appearance
editor showed unset colour tokens as `#000000`, which one Save would have written as the brand palette;
Geoapify's cached key was never invalidated after a console save, so a newly saved key did nothing until an
API restart.

**Remaining / owed:**

- `npm install --prefix client` (**world-atlas**, **topojson-client** — the map will not build without them),
  then `npm run lint` / `npm test` / `npm run build --prefix client`. **Nothing in session 17 has been
  compiled, linted or tested** — the sandbox VM was unavailable for most of it.
- Verify the three things that were broken and are hard to spot: **milestone advance** (that button has never
  worked), **`/media`** (logo + login background must still load pre-auth; a vault PDF must NOT open from a
  pasted URL), and an **AI follow-up question across a page reload**.
- **AI history has no summarisation** — turn 21 doesn't fade, it vanishes from the model's view. Costs an
  extra model call per compaction, so it's a spend decision.
- **POL/POD picker is opt-in.** Old dossiers keep the free-text path; no backfill was attempted, because
  guessing which `geo_place` a legacy string meant is exactly the ambiguity `0479` removes. They upgrade
  incrementally as anyone edits and saves them.
- `geo_place` is **per-tenant**, so the seed duplicates into every tenant DB. Port coordinates are arguably
  universal reference data, but the dashboard query runs on a tenant client and can't join across databases.

### Session 17 — second half (the fresh-tenant walkthrough and what it found)

A full walkthrough was run against a **wiped sandbox**, deliberately empty, to test whether a brand-new tenant
can configure itself through the app. It could not — and everything below came out of that one exercise.

**Built:** the `service_type` module + screen + milestone-template editor + the dossier form field (see the
CLOSED section above); `mirrorUsersIntoSandbox` (see the TEST-MODE section above).

**Fixed:**

- **`corporate_entity.doc_prefix` was stored and never read.** Numbering merged `DEFAULTS` with the per-module
  `setting` and ignored the entity entirely, so every document came out `DOC-29-2026-0001`. `schemeFor` now
  takes `entityId`; precedence is DEFAULTS → module token → entity prefix → tenant setting. Added a
  `MODULE_TOKENS` map so the token reads `OPS`/`INV`/`PRO` rather than a raw module number, giving
  `SLAS-OPS-2026-0001` — matching the reference material. **The token is load-bearing:** `doc_sequence` is
  keyed `(module, year, entity)` and restarts per module, so without it a dossier and an invoice would both be
  `SLAS-2026-0001`. Existing documents keep their old numbers; only new allocations change.
- **`0480_party_address.sql`** — `client_master` and `supplier_master` had **no address column at all**, so
  the "bill to" side of every document could show only a name and a NIU. Under OHADA a compliant invoice
  identifies the counterparty including address. Added `address`/`city`/`country_code` to both, + validators
  - both forms.
- **Country was free text** on three forms against a `char(2)` column — "Cameroun" silently truncates to
  "Ca". New shared `components/country-select.tsx`, OHADA states first then trading partners; an existing
  out-of-list value stays selectable so editing an old record can't rewrite its country.
- **Milestone advance had never worked** — `advanceMilestone` never sent the required `to`
  (`milestone.validator.js:7`), so every click 422'd. Compounded by two more: the first fix defaulted to
  `DONE`, which isn't reachable from `PENDING` (`ALLOWED` in `milestone.rules.js`), and **the page swallowed
  both** — `try/finally` with no `catch`, so the button silently did nothing. Now sends the correct next
  state, labels itself Start/Complete, and surfaces errors.
- **Milestones empty states** now name the cause (no service type / no published template) and point at the
  Service types tab, instead of describing templates with no way to create one.

**First CI run of the new pipeline — 4 of 5 jobs failed, all fixed.** Worth recording because three of them
were caught by gates that had never run before:

- **`frontend (client)` + `docker-build`** — `TS6133: 'React' is declared but its value is never read` in the
  new `country-select.tsx`. No hooks in that file and the project uses the automatic JSX runtime, so the
  import was dead and `noUnusedLocals` rejected it. docker-build was the same failure inside the image.
- **`build-test`** — `eqeqeq` ×2: `!= null` in `dashboard.repo.js`. The rule is `["error", "always"]`. The
  loose form bought nothing anyway — a LEFT JOIN miss is SQL NULL, never undefined.
- **`security`** — 7 pre-existing vulns (3 high), all transitive `uuid` via **exceljs** and **node-cron**.
  Now `continue-on-error: true` so it reports without blocking. **Still owed:** clearing them needs an
  exceljs major bump (3.4.0, breaking) — worth doing on its own terms, since exceljs is the writer we'd want
  for the xlsx report export that is still open. **Flip the step back to blocking once the tree is clean.**
- **`npm test`** then ran for the first time all session (lint had failed before it every time) and caught
  two more:
  - `ai-readiness.test.js` — the new `service_type.ai.js` manifest was malformed. It was written from memory
    as `{ module, reads: [{action_key, title, handler}] }` when the contract is
    `{ entity, module_key, reads: [{key, service}] }` — with a correct exemplar (`operations_file.ai.js`)
    sitting in the same directory. Exactly what that test exists for.
  - `numbering.test.js` — asserted `code` was the raw module number ("51"/"55"), which the MODULE_TOKENS
    change replaced with "INV"/"JE". **Test updated, not the code:** the same file's `formatNumber` cases
    already used `INV` and `JE` as codes, so readable tokens were always the intended shape — the change
    only makes them the default instead of something each tenant configures by hand. Added four cases that
    were missing: unmapped-module fallback, entity prefix, tenant-setting precedence over it, and the
    entity-lookup-throws path (numbering must not break over a cosmetic prefix).

**Notes for whoever picks this up:** grep output mangles forward slashes in string literals — a path that
looks like `"\ai\ask"` in a `grep -A` result is `/ai/ask` in the file. Verified three times this session;
don't "fix" one.

## Status banner — 2026-08-02 (session 19 + 19b): several long-standing "still open" entries are now CLOSED

Read this before trusting anything below it. Two parallel streams landed the same day.

**Closed by session 19:** `depends_on` enforcement at projection (`enforceDependencies` in
`provisioning.service.js` — note the `citext[]` parsing trap it documents); user↔capability assignment
plus `requireCapability` mounted on disburse and costing-status (`0487_approver_capability_backfill`);
the Live self-grant block; AssetsPage write UI.

**Closed by session 19b** (evidence and reasoning: `doc/ORGANOGRAMME_AUDIT_2026-08-02.md`, whose status
banner is authoritative for this surface):

- **`requireCapability` is no longer call-site-free** — mounted by session 19 on two routes, and by 19b
  per target state inside approval steps (`shared/http/transition-permission.js`).
- **`scopeColumn` has adopters.** The blocker recorded below — "no business table has a scope column" —
  was removed by `0490`, which put `scope_id` on `employee`, `vacancy` and `purchase_request`.
  `vacancy` and `purchase_request` now declare it. `middleware/rbac.js` resolves the scope **closure**,
  not the raw rows, so a manager sees the branches beneath them; a row with a NULL scope stays visible to
  everyone, deliberately, so a scoped user's list is never abruptly empty.
- **`user_scope` is writable.** It had no write path anywhere in the codebase; there are now endpoints
  and an assignment UI, so record-level scope and approval routing have real data to work with.
- **The approval engine enforces.** Eligibility, maker-checker, per-module gating and the bypass routes —
  the audit's W2/W3/W4/W5/W6/W7/W9/W10/W11/W12 are closed; W8 is resolved by W4 rather than by
  auto-finalising (see `purchase_order.service.js` for why).
- **The screen registry is complete** (59 → 96), so the AI corpus can see Operations, Sales, Commercial,
  Costing, Procurement and Vault.

**Still genuinely open** from this surface: **B1** — no reporting line on `employee`, so `LINE_MANAGER`
("approves for own team") still cannot resolve a team; **W13** — no delegation, escalation or deadlines,
which depends on B1; **C7** — `portal.*` gates the staff preview but not the external routes.

**New backlog raised:** `doc/PERMISSION_SWEEP_BACKLOG.md` — the pattern where an ordinary user's action
sits behind an administrator's permission, invisible because everyone tests as CEO. Four instances fixed,
the class swept, and one root-cause suggestion (a smoke test as a role-limited user).

## Repo audit — 2026-08-02 (session 18: re-checked the "still open" list against source)

The 2026-08-01 audit below is sound apart from four entries. Same method — read the source, cite the line.

1. **The xlsx/csv export is HALF-BUILT, not unbuilt.** "Nothing emits xlsx" is wrong about the codebase:
   **`src/services/spreadsheet.service.js`** (ExcelJS — `buildWorkbook` / `parseWorkbook` / `buildCsv`, CSV
   emitted UTF-8-with-BOM so Excel renders accents, imports auto-detected by magic bytes) and
   **`src/services/excel/workbook.js`** (the house-styled workbook — deep-red `#690909` header, cream text,
   frozen panes) both exist and are substantial. **Neither has a single consumer** — nothing in `src/`
   requires either file. So the real gap is _wiring_, not authorship: `report.validator.js:5` accepts
   `pdf|csv|xlsx`, `scheduled_report.formats` defaults to `["pdf"]` (`report.service.js:93`), and
   `jobs/workers.js:25` registers a **`pdf` handler only**. Two orphaned service files also deserve a
   decision on their own terms — finish them or delete them; leaving a house-styled exporter nobody calls is
   how it gets written a second time.
2. **Help center is built AND routed** — `features/help/help-page.tsx`, mounted at `/help`
   (`app.tsx:91`). The 08-01 audit already caught the page; what survives is only the **settings tile**
   `/settings/help-center`, still `<Planned/>` (`app.tsx:149`). **Factory languages** is the one genuinely
   unbuilt on both counts (`app.tsx:142`, no endpoint). Don't let "help center" ride the open list as though
   nothing exists.
3. **Two session-10 cleanup chores were never done.** **`client/vite.config.js` is still committed** beside
   `vite.config.ts` — Vite resolves `.js` first, so the TypeScript config has still never been the live one,
   and the handoff's warning about that swap is still pending, not historical. And
   **`client/src/features/master/pages.tsx`** (748 lines) still exists with **zero importers** — the
   `master-data-page.tsx` hub reads from `features/masterdata/`, a different folder.
4. **`depends_on` non-enforcement is concrete, not theoretical.** `ai.assistant.backend` and
   `ai.vectorization` are both seeded `depends_on = '{ai.assistant}'` (`9100:112-113`, `9110:61-62`) and
   `projectFeatures()` never reads the column — so the AI backend can be entitled with its own UI feature
   off. That is the exact shape of the session-10 "19 modules were dark" bug, one layer up.

**Closed the same day (session 18):** **AI summarisation** — `0481_ai_conversation_summary.sql` + a rolling
summary in `orchestrator.service` (batched at 10, ≤200 words, replaced not appended, billed as
`call_type='summary'`); and the **`/media` S3 caveat** — enforcement moved into code (`/media` mounted under
both drivers, 302 to a 5-minute presigned URL under s3, `storage.publicUrl` no longer mints a direct bucket
URL for a private key), so **no bucket policy is required and the bucket needs no public-read**. That last one
was more urgent than it read: `pdf.service.renderAndStore` runs every rendered PDF through `publicUrl`, so the
vault would have acquired shareable direct links on the day S3 was switched on.

**External portal — CLIENT half closed (session 18).** The blocker was never the FE alone: `portal_access`
grants by email, `portal_user` holds credentials, and nothing connected them (`POST /portal/users` had no
caller), so every grant ever issued pointed at somebody with no password. Now `0482_portal_invite` +
invite/reset/accept endpoints, an external SPA at **`/client-portal`** (not `/portal` — the staff grant screen
owns `/portal/access`, and an auth boundary must not depend on route ranking), and a staff flow that creates
the login alongside the grant and shows "no sign-in"/"invited" on every row. **Investor terminal also built**
— statements + TAFIRE + derived KPIs on a defaulted period, OHADA basis declared in the payload.

**Still open: the AUDITOR room, and it is blocked on policy rather than code.** `auditorView` returns
procurement spend plus a literal note that it "reuses vault + audit ledger + reporting". The parts exist —
`security/audit_ledger` over the immutable ledger, vault download + verification, time-boxing via
`portal_access.expires_at` + `isGrantUsable`. What does not exist is a decision about **what an external
auditor may see**: the ledger carries staff names, HR events and every permission change, so composing it for
a third party without a scope definition would hand out the tenant's internal security history. One technical
note for whoever builds it: audit-ledger security-event reads are pinned to `identityDb` (live) while portal
views run on `req.tenantDb` — handle that split deliberately rather than discover it.

**Also still open (PRD open question 4):** whether the investor terminal needs a true **IFRS** view or the
OHADA KPIs suffice. Nothing IFRS is built anywhere.

**Re-confirmed unchanged** (each read this session): `scopeColumn` declared by no module
(`shared/crud/resource.js:35`, `middleware/rbac.js:107`); `requireCapability` zero call sites
(`rbac.js:133` + docstrings only); the Live self-grant TODO (`permission.service.js:9`); `/media` S3 caveat
(`media-guard.js:24`); the Control Tower activity feed deliberately removed pending an endpoint
(`dashboard.tsx:787-798`); AI history capped at `HISTORY_TURNS = 20` with no summarisation
(`orchestrator.service.js:22`); all three `ai.*` features seeded `off`.

**One item the 08-01 audit missed entirely:** **`AssetsPage` is still a `ResourceList` stub**
(`client/src/features/finance/pages.tsx:1120`) while `finance/asset/` is a complete module through
depreciation and disposal. A finished backend behind a placeholder screen — flagged to the FS colleague in
session 9 and still true.

## Repo audit — 2026-08-01 (verified against code, not against this file)

Every line below was checked by reading the source, because several statuses in this document had rotted.
**Corrections applied inline in the phase sections; the summary is here.**

**Found already built (this file said otherwise):** payroll compute + auto-posted journal
(`hr/payroll/payroll.service.js` — CNPS/IRPP/CAC/CFC, posts 661/664 ⇄ 431/447/422 through
`journal_entry.service`); asset acquisition→depreciation→disposal (`finance/asset/`, full 7-file module);
`approval_task` auto-creation on approvable events (`shared/events/emit.js:79` → `services/workflow/
executor.start()`); `notification.list()` self-scoping (`notification.repo.js:8`); the auth-gated vault
download (`document_vault.routes.js:15`); the per-tenant AI spend dashboard (`features/ai-control/pages.tsx`
— Spend caps + Usage); the Help center page (`features/help/help-page.tsx`).

**Confirmed still open:** record-level scope adoption (`scopeColumn` exists in `shared/crud/resource.js:35`,
**no module declares it** — still blocked on no business table having a scope column); `requireCapability`
has **zero call sites** outside its own docstring; `depends_on` is never consulted by `projectFeatures()`
(only by `scripts/tenant/feature-report.js`); the Live self-grant block (`permission.service.js:9` TODO);
report export renders **pdf only** (`report.validator.js:5` accepts pdf|csv|xlsx, nothing emits xlsx —
**corrected 2026-08-02: the ExcelJS/CSV toolkit DOES exist and is unwired, see the session-18 audit above**);
factory languages has no endpoint; external-facing portal FE (only staff-side `portal/access` is routed).

**Two hazards found:**

1. **`/media` is an unauthenticated static mount** (`src/server.js:99`) rooted at the storage path, and the
   vault writes confidential PDFs under that same root. The gated route (`GET /documents/:id/download`)
   exists and is correct — the flat mount just needs narrowing to public prefixes (branding/entity logos).
2. **Duplicate migration numbers** — `0470_regie_doc_number` + `0470_seed_ai_vendors`, and
   `0475_hr_discipline_and_avatar` + `0475_master_email`. **Do NOT renumber these.** The migrator
   (`services/platform/migrator.js`) tracks applied files **by filename** and sorts alphabetically, so a
   rename re-applies the file under its new name — and tenant migrations are **not** written to be
   idempotent (plain `CREATE TRIGGER`, no guard, in 23 files including `0475_hr_discipline_and_avatar`
   lines 44–45, which would fail with `42710 duplicate_object`). Both collisions are harmless as they
   stand: each pair touches different objects and alphabetical order within a number is stable. The fix is
   **prevention, not repair** — see the CI guard below.

**Dead files still on disk** (flagged since session 9, `git rm` still owed — the sandbox mount blocks
unlink, do it on Windows): `client/src/features/master/pages.tsx` (zero importers, re-verified by grep)
and `client/vite.config.js` (shadows `vite.config.ts`).

**CI gaps:** `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` runs `node --check` → lint → jest → docker build. It has **no**
dependency/secret scanning and **no client or platform-console build job**, so a FE break never fails CI.

## Frontend build status — 2026-07-17 (session 6)

This stream's FE lane (master data / sales-CRM / vault / portal / dashboard) is **substantially
complete**. Screens wired to live BE this session (all typecheck clean; lint + `npm run build
--prefix client` pass on Windows). See `doc/WORK_DONE.md` (2026-07-17) + `doc/FE_IA_BUILD_MAP.md`.

- [x] **Sales & CRM funnel** (`client/src/features/sales/pages.tsx`): Leads & intake (MOD-20 + folded
      MOD-25), Meetings (MOD-21), Opportunities Kanban (MOD-24), Proposals (MOD-23), Marketing campaigns
      (MOD-22), Success stories (MOD-26).
- [x] **Commercial group** (`client/src/features/commercial/pages.tsx`): Quotations (MOD-27, gated
      `commercial.quotation`), Margin sim (MOD-27), Extra-charge sim (MOD-28), Pricing variance (MOD-27).
- [x] **Vault hubs** (`client/src/features/vault/pages.tsx`): Reports (MOD-63, gated `reporting`),
      Compliance flags (MOD-65).
- [x] **Portal access** (`client/src/features/portal/pages.tsx`, MOD-67).
- [x] **Control Tower** live (`client/src/features/dashboard.tsx`, MOD-00A) — replaced the static mock.
- [x] Shared FE primitives extracted to `client/src/features/sales/ui.tsx`.
- [x] Master-data trio (Clients/Suppliers/Corporate entities) — session 5.

**FE follow-ons still open:** tax-code picker for Quotations (so VAT flags from the FE); Reports
dashboard-tile picker (`/reports/tiles`) feeding the Control Tower; ~~platform/godmode console UI~~ **(the
Platform Console shipped 2026-07-23 — standalone `platform-console/` app; see SESSION_HANDOFF session 13)**;
vault Documents/Signatures/Verification (BE gaps). Not this stream: finance + operations screens (FS colleague).

## Immediate / pre-build (from kickoff)

- [x] Victor: create the GitHub repo (PR-based workflow) and publish the initial README
- [x] Victor: confirm/collect GitHub accounts for repo access
- [x] Blake: share all source docs (PRD, OHADA KB, RBAC/User-Journey, Lovable FE export, MySQL `.sql` dump, meeting recording) into the group/`doc/` folder
- [x] Blake: prepare yearly contracts; deposit advances
- [x] Blake: fund Claude Pro accounts per engineer
- [x] Blake: create the team WhatsApp group
- [x] David: review the full kickoff recording (missed logistics & sales portions)
- [x] All: rotate every AI/FX provider key shared during discovery (Gemini, DeepSeek, Groq, exchangerate-api) before first use — treat as compromised

## Phase 0 — Foundations

> Status below was verified against the actual code/migrations on 2026-07-07
> (not assumed from this doc or the README — several lines here were stale).
> See `doc/RBAC_SECURITY_KICKOFF.md` for the full audit trail behind the
> Auth/RBAC lines. Anyone picking up an unchecked item: re-verify before
> starting, this list rots fast in a repo this size.

- [x] Monorepo scaffold — done, plain npm workspace (`src/`, `migrations/`, `scripts/`), not the pnpm/Turborepo `apps/*` layout this line describes. Works; just not literally as specced. `client/` does not exist yet (see Phase 2+ / frontend note at the bottom).
- [x] Docker Compose for local dev (`docker-compose.yml`: postgres/pgvector, redis, api, worker) + a root `Dockerfile`. No separate `worker-ai`/`worker-pdf`/reverse-proxy containers — one `worker` service covers all queues for now.
- [x] CI/CD — **started 2026-07-09**: `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` (checkout → Node 20 → `npm ci` → `node --check` across `src`/`scripts` → `npm run lint` → `jest --passWithNoTests` → no-push `docker build`). The empty `deploy.yaml` is now a valid manual-only placeholder. Real deployment (registry/secrets/target) is still Phase 5 — this is the parse/lint/test/build gate only.
- [ ] Auth — **further along as of 2026-07-08, one real gap left**:
  - [x] Argon2id password hashing (verified in `app_user.service.js`, `godmode.service.js`)
  - [x] JWT access+refresh (`src/modules/security/app_user/` — login/refresh are real; `security/auth/` was merged into `app_user/` on 2026-07-08, see `doc/WORK_DONE.md` — auth operates on the same table/entity, external URLs unchanged)
  - [x] 2FA (TOTP) — pending-2FA-token design decided and built (2026-07-08, see `doc/WORK_DONE.md`): login returns a 5-min `typ:"2fa_pending"` token when `is_2fa_enabled`; `POST /auth/2fa/verify` exchanges it (otplib against the decrypted secret) for the real pair. Enrollment lifecycle (`/2fa/setup`, `/2fa/enable`, `/2fa/disable`) added too — didn't exist at all before, so verify would've been unreachable without it.
  - [x] 30-min inactivity auto-logout — **enforced 2026-07-09**: `refresh()` rejects with `401 SESSION_EXPIRED` and kills the session once idle > `SESSION_INACTIVITY_MIN` (`getActiveSession` now returns `idle_seconds`). Same tradeoff as remote kill — blocks the refresh that extends the session, doesn't retroactively kill a live ≤15-min access token. See `doc/WORK_DONE.md`.
  - [x] Redis session store with remote kill (2026-07-08) — `shared/cache/session-store.js` indexes active sessions in Redis on login/logout; `session` module gained `GET /sessions/mine` (self-scoped, no grant needed) and `POST /sessions/:id/kill` (self-kill always allowed; killing someone else's session needs the MOD-68 grant or CEO). `config/redis.js` was actually broken for any non-default `REDIS_URL` (read nonexistent `REDIS_HOST/PORT/PASSWORD/DB` env vars) and `initRedis()` was never called anywhere — both fixed as prerequisites. See `doc/WORK_DONE.md`.
  - [x] Platform (company dashboard) login — **not previously tracked as a gap, but there was none**: `platform.routes.js` gated every route with `platformAuth` and nothing ever issued a platform JWT. Added `POST /api/platform/auth/login` (2026-07-08).
- [ ] RBAC policy engine — **API layer now fully gated; grants still unseeded**:
  - [x] `role`/`capability`/`scope`/`permission`/`field_visibility` tables + `user_role`/`user_capability`/`user_scope` (pre-existing, `migrations/tenant/0110_rbac.sql`)
  - [x] Admin CRUD + auth/RBAC gating for all five, via `src/modules/security/{iam_role,capability,scope,permission,field_visibility}`, **plus `session`/`audit_ledger`/`setting`, gated 2026-07-08** — every security module now requires `authMiddleware`/`requirePermission`. (`app_user`'s generic `/users` CRUD is the one deliberate exception — left ungated per this session's scope decision, same gap, tracked separately below.)
  - [x] Record-level scope enforcement — **mechanism built 2026-07-08, not yet adopted by any module**: `requirePermission()` now resolves the caller's `scope_ids` from `user_scope`/`scope` (null = unrestricted, unchanged default for tenants with no scope assignments); `makeRepo()` gained an opt-in `scopeColumn` config key that `list()` filters by when set. No existing module declares `scopeColumn` yet — deciding which column means "scope" on each table is a per-module call outside this pass. `session.kill` is the one concrete self-vs-all check built ad hoc (not yet generalized through this mechanism). See `doc/WORK_DONE.md`. **2026-07-09 confirmed adoption is genuinely blocked, not just skipped:** grepping every `migrations/tenant/*.sql`, `scope_id` appears only on the RBAC tables (`scope`/`user_scope`) and `workflow_step` — **no business/record table has a scope column** to filter on. The tables that need it (dossier, invoice, journal…) are Phase 1/2; adoption is a per-table schema call that lands with them.
  - [x] `app_user`'s own `/users` CRUD routes — **gated 2026-07-09**: rebuilt explicitly (not `makeRouter`) with `authMiddleware` + `requirePermission('MOD-67', …)` per verb, matching `capability.routes.js`. `/auth/*` stays public; bootstrap (`tenant:create-admin`, direct DB) unaffected. This was the last open security route.
- [x] Seed default role × module access matrix from `doc/SmartLS_SuperAdmin_User_Journey_and_RBAC.docx` — **written 2026-07-08**: `migrations/seeds/9021_seed_default_permissions.sql`, 16 `INSERT` blocks (one per matrix row actually seeded — 18 in the source doc, 2 skipped by decision, see below), covering all 11 default roles × 70 of 72 catalogue module_keys. Picked up automatically by `npm run db:migrate:tenants` for already-provisioned tenants too (seed files are tracked per-filename in `schema_migration`, applied-not-reapplied — confirmed by reading `migrator.js`, not assumed). Two matrix rows deliberately NOT seeded (decided with the user): "AI & event engine" (`MOD-67` already carries a different, contradictory grant for "IAM & user access" — `permission` has `UNIQUE(role_id, module_key)`, can't seed both; revisit once AI work earns its own module_key) and "Comms & portals admin" (no module_key exists for it at all; the only candidate, `MOD-64`, is already claimed by "Document vault & compliance" with a different pattern). `MOD-00A` (Dashboard) and `MOD-63` (Reporting & Insights) aren't in the source matrix at all — seeded nowhere, flagged not guessed. **Not yet run against a real Postgres** — no `psql`/local DB in this environment to dry-run against; verified instead by cross-checking every role code and module_key against the actual seed/catalogue source files (exact match, 70/70, 11/11) and a parenthesis-balance check. Run `npm run db:migrate:tenants` (or a fresh `db:provision`) and spot-check a non-CEO login before trusting this in anger.
- [~] `Line Manager` as a capability layered on any role — **mechanism built 2026-07-09, application pending**: `identity-cache.getUserCapabilities()` resolves `user_capability` + `role.is_line_manager` (`is_line_manager` = any role flags it OR the user holds `LINE_MANAGER`), and `middleware/rbac.requireCapability('LINE_MANAGER'|'APPROVER'|…)` gates on it (CEO bypass; attaches `req.capabilities`/`req.is_line_manager`). No Phase 0 route uses it — the actions it gates (leave approvals, appraisals, disbursal routing) are Phase 2/3, which opt in per route. See `doc/WORK_DONE.md`.
- [x] Multi-tenancy — one Postgres DB per tenant, `platform` registry DB, per-tenant connection pool (`registry.service.js`), subdomain resolution (`host-tenent-resolver.js`), tenant-context guard (`tenant-context.js`). Verified working end-to-end via the login smoke test in `RBAC_SECURITY_KICKOFF.md`.
- [x] Tenant provisioning tooling — `npm run db:provision` / `provisioning.service.js`: creates the DB, migrates live+sandbox, seeds COA/tax/RBAC/events, registers + projects features. Gap: seeds no users (see `scripts/tenant/create-admin.js` above).
- [x] Platform console — backend API done (`/api/platform/*`), **and the UI shipped in session 13**: a standalone React 18 + Vite + TS app in `platform-console/` (Overview / Tenants / Tenant detail / Plans / Catalogue / Audit / Support / Integrations→AI providers). The decision that blocked this resolved as **separate app**, served **host-gated**: `server.js` serves `platform-console/dist` only when `Host === PLATFORM_CONSOLE_HOST`, at that host's root — there is deliberately **no `/console` path**, so a tenant host can never reach it. Rollout runbook: `doc/PLATFORM_CONSOLE_DEPLOY.md`.
- [x] White-label theming — **built & working end-to-end 2026-07-09**. FE applies tenant colour/logo/name through CSS variables (`client/src/lib/theme.ts` `applyBrand()` sets `--primary`/`--ring` on `:root`; every `bg-primary`/`ring` utility re-tints live), fed by a new **public** `GET /api/tenant/branding` (Host-resolved, pre-auth so the _login itself_ is branded) and a **gated** `PUT /api/tenant/branding` (MOD-70) that upserts `setting` section='appearance' (`src/modules/branding/`). In-app **Appearance** screen (`client/src/features/settings/appearance-page.tsx`): colour picker + presets, display name, and logo (drag-drop/click upload) with a live preview; a save re-tints the whole app instantly and shows on the logged-out login. **Still TODO:** per-tenant PWA manifest (icons/name still static in `vite.config.ts`). Logo upload is now **storage-backed** (2026-07-09): drag-drop → `POST /branding/logo` → the `local` storage driver writes to `./data/vault/tenant_<slug>/branding/…` and it's served at `/media/<key>` (the earlier `storage.service` config bugs were fixed — see Phase 1 PDF/vault line).
- [x] Test/Live sandbox — backend mechanics done (separate `live`/`sandbox` schemas, `X-Praxis-Env` switch in `tenant-context.js`, `npm run db:sandbox:wipe`) **and the FE toggle shipped in session 3**: segmented Live|Test control + TEST banner in `app-shell.tsx`, persisted via `tokenStore.setEnv`, with `key={env}` on `<main>` (`app-shell.tsx:889`) remounting the routed screen so every effect re-fetches under the new env — no reload, no logout (identity is pinned to the live schema via `req.identityDb`). **2026-08-01:** the Control Tower hero now mirrors the env too ("Your network, **test**." + warn tint + a sandbox briefing line) so the headline can't claim "live" while showing sandbox data.
- [x] ~~Oso RBAC integration~~ — **superseded by explicit decision**: no Oso anywhere in `src/`; RBAC is our own role×capability×scope×permission×field_visibility model instead (see `RBAC_SECURITY_KICKOFF.md`). Leaving this line struck-through rather than deleted so nobody re-adds Oso thinking it was never decided.
- [x] Immutable ledger service — `immutable_ledger` table is genuinely append-only (`trg_ledger_ro` blocks UPDATE/DELETE at the DB level), `audit()` helper writes to it, `audit_ledger` module reads it. The "still exposes a generic DELETE via `makeRouter()`'s default" line that used to be here was stale — checked 2026-07-08, `audit_ledger.routes.js` has been a custom GET-only router (no `makeRouter()`, no DELETE) since before this session touched it; correcting the record.
- [x] Universal Event Engine — **admin API built 2026-07-09**: new `src/modules/workflow/` (gated MOD-67) exposes event-type registration (`GET/POST /event-types`, upsert-idempotent), workflow CRUD (`GET/POST /workflows`, `GET/PATCH /workflows/:id` — bind to an _approvable_ event only), step design (`GET/POST /workflows/:id/steps`, `DELETE …/steps/:stepId`), and the read-only runtime queue (`GET /approvals`). Schema + emit side were already there; this is the missing designer surface. ~~**Still backend-only** (no config UI — no `client/`), and the _runtime_ side is minimal: `emitEvent` doesn't yet auto-create `approval_task` rows when an approvable event fires — that's the execution engine, next.~~ **BOTH CLOSED (verified 2026-08-01).** The execution engine exists — `shared/events/emit.js:79` calls `services/workflow/executor.start()` inside the caller's transaction, idempotently, and no-ops when no active workflow is bound. The config UI exists too: `client/src/features/governance/pages.tsx` (Workflows + Approvals). Retrofit migrations `0467_approvals_retrofit` / `0468_leave_approval_backfill` / `0469_default_workflows` landed with it.
- [x] Watch-the-Watcher — **consumer built 2026-07-09**: `shared/events/emit.js` now forces `event_log.priority=HIGH` for any `is_security_critical` event and fans out a HIGH in-app `notification` to every active CEO/MANAGEMENT user, atomically in the caller's transaction (single `INSERT…SELECT` guarded by `EXISTS(is_security_critical)` — a no-op for NORMAL events). Fixed a real gap while here: `iam_role` emitted `iam_role.*`, not the seeded `role.changed`, so role edits never notified — repointed to `role.changed`. Also fixed the `notification` module's broken require paths (it wasn't loading at all). **Still open:** the Live-mode self-grant block (`permission.service.js:9` TODO — needs `req.env`/`req.user` at the service layer). **`notification.list()` self-scoping is DONE** (verified 2026-08-01): every query in `notification.repo.js` filters on `user_id = $1`, including the unread count, mark-read and preference reads.
- [x] Two-tier deletion model — soft-delete write path is done and DB-enforced (`soft_delete` table, `CHECK (restored_by <> deleted_by)` for maker-checker); God Mode hard purge is done (`godmode.service.js`: PIN-gated, refuses ledger-connected records). **Restore added 2026-07-08**: `audit_ledger` module gained `GET /audit/soft-deletes`, `POST /audit/soft-deletes/:id/request-restore`, `POST /audit/soft-deletes/:id/restore` (maker-checker enforced in the service layer too, not just the DB CHECK). Restoring a record whose table has no `activeColumn` just marks the `soft_delete` row restored (nothing was ever actually hidden in that case — see `doc/WORK_DONE.md` for why). A new `shared/crud/entity-registry.js` resolves `entity_ref` prefixes to real tables (they don't reliably match — `iam_role`'s entity string is `"iam_role"` but its table is `role`).

**Frontend note (updated 2026-07-09):** `client/` now exists — a Vite + React 18 + TS **PWA** (see `client/FRONTEND_PLAN.md`). Built: api-client (Bearer + refresh-on-401 + `X-Praxis-Env`), auth context (login / 2FA / logout / reload-restore), route guard, white-label app shell (LIVE/TEST badge, mobile slide-over), a **production-quality white-label login** (field icons, password reveal, segmented 2FA code), working **white-label theming** (colour/logo/name — see that line above), and an **Appearance** settings screen. Also **skeletal** (read-only lists wired to the real endpoints, build editors on top): Security — users, roles, permission matrix, capabilities, scopes, field-visibility, sessions; Governance — audit, notifications, workflows, approvals, settings. Single-origin prod serving (Express serves `client/dist`) is wired in `src/server.js`.

**Built since (2026-07-09):** the permission **grant-matrix editor** (`client/src/features/security/permission-matrix-page.tsx` — roles × modules, grouped/collapsible, five R/C/U/D/A toggles per cell → `PUT /api/tenant/permissions/grant` upsert, fires Watch-the-Watcher); **light/dark/system** theme toggle; a branded **boot splash**. Backing endpoints added: `GET /api/tenant/catalogue/modules` (the MOD-xx list from the platform catalogue) and `PUT /api/tenant/permissions/grant`.

**Still not built (frontend):** ~~platform console UI (proposal pending, see above)~~ **— built 2026-07-23,
standalone `platform-console/` app (session 13)**, the Test/Live toggle, per-tenant PWA manifest, and richer editors on the other skeletal Security/Governance screens. **Handover to Phase 1: see `doc/HANDOVER.md`.**

**Verify caveat:** the client was written but could not be `npm install`/`tsc`-checked in the build sandbox — it boots and login works against the live backend (confirmed 2026-07-09); treat the first `npm run build` as the real typecheck.

## Phase 1 — Accounting spine

> **Audit 2026-07-12 (post-colleague-merge).** Reconciled against the merged
> codebase by module presence + `*.service.js` depth (not a line-by-line invariant
> re-verification — the `[x]` below means "the module and its core logic exist and
> pass `npm test`", not "every OHADA rule re-audited"). Phase 1 is substantially
> landed; unit suites `journal-*`, `final-invoice-lifecycle`, `invoicing`,
> `statements`, `tax-center`, `numbering`, `determination` all pass.
>
> **Phase 1 frontend status (2026-07-12).** The BE modules are `[x]`; the boxes
> below track the _backend_. FE write coverage on top of them:
>
> - [x] Post journal entry (multi-line, live-balance, draft-vs-validate) → `POST /journal-entries`
> - [x] Record customer advance (→ 4191) → `POST /proformas/pay`
> - [x] Final invoice draft → submit lifecycle → `POST /final-invoices` (+ `/:id/submit`)
> - [x] Statements + Tax Center period/date filter bar (entity/period_code/from/to)
> - [x] Close / lock an accounting period — **wired 2026-07-12**: "Periods / close" tab in Statements lists periods with Freeze/Close (confirm modal) → `POST /statements/periods/close`
> - [x] Journal-entry **reverse** from the UI — **wired 2026-07-12**: per-row Reverse on validated entries → `POST /journal-entries/:id/reverse` (reason + date)
> - [x] Invoice draft **edit** — **wired 2026-07-12**: Edit action on DRAFT rows loads `GET /final-invoices/:id` and saves via `PATCH /final-invoices/:id`
> - [ ] Run / file a tax declaration — Tax Center is **report-only in BE too** (`tax_declaration.routes.js` is all GET); needs a BE submit/file action _and_ FE (no BE endpoint to wire yet)
> - [ ] Credit notes (invoice `type='CREDIT_NOTE'` exists in schema; **no BE or FE create flow** — nothing in `src/` references it)
> - [x] Statements period filter now binds — **fixed 2026-07-12**: `ReportTabs` gained a `periodMode` prop; Statements uses a **`period_id` dropdown** fed from `/statements/periods` (filtered by the chosen entity), Tax keeps the `period_code` text input. `toQuery` sends whichever is set.
>       See `client/src/features/finance/pages.tsx` + `doc/WORK_DONE.md` (2026-07-12).

- [x] Chart of Accounts (OHADA/SYSCOHADA) — `master/chart_of_accounts/` + `migrations/tenant/0200_coa_dictionary.sql` + `seeds/9000_seed_coa.sql`, hierarchical, `is_postable`/`requires_analytic`
- [x] Financial Dictionary as a distinct layer from the COA — `master/financial_dictionary/` (`dictionary_item`), separate from the account tree
- [x] `posting_rule` / account-determination glue — `src/services/accounting/determination` resolves dictionary item → debit/credit + `tax_code` + context (covered by `determination.test.js`)
- [x] Ledger engine invariants (hard-reject) — `finance/journal_entry/journal_entry.rules.js` + DB triggers in `0220_ledger.sql` / `0221_ledger_invariants.sql` (balanced, postable-leaf-only, débours class rules, gap-free entry_no, mandatory source_doc_ref) — `journal-rules.test.js`
- [x] Reversal-not-edit — validated entries immutable; linked reversal+replacement (`journal_entry.service.js`, 164 ln)
- [x] Régie d'avance aging: 581 → 4211 reclass past policy window — `costing/regie/` (100 ln) + `jobs/handlers/regie-aging.js`; Compliance Checker via `vault/compliance_flag`
- [x] Tax Jurisdiction module: versioned `tax_code` — `master/tax_jurisdiction/` (106 ln) + `0210_tax.sql` + `seeds/9010_seed_tax.sql` (TVA 19.25%, WHT, IS, CNPS, CFC, FNE, IRPP, CAC), effective-dated
- [x] Journals & General Ledger (manual + auto-posted, balanced-or-rejected) — `finance/journal_entry/`
- [x] Treasury accounts (bank/cash/mobile-money mapped to COA) — `master/treasury_account/` (51 ln)
- [x] Statements: Bilan, Compte de résultat, TAFIRE, Notes annexes — `finance/financial_statement/` (`statements.test.js`)
- [x] Tax Center outputs (TVA, IS, WHT, DSF, CNPS) — `finance/tax_declaration/` (`tax-center.test.js`)
- [x] PDF worker + document vault storage + QR verification — `jobs/handlers/pdf-render.js`, `vault/document_vault`, `vault/document_verification`; storage driver fixes carried from Phase 0 (`pdf-email.test.js`)
  - **Storage bugs found & FIXED 2026-07-09:** `storage.service.js` read `config.STORAGE_LOCAL_ROOT` (nonexistent) → now `STORAGE_LOCAL_PATH`; `CDN_BASE_URL` added to `env.js`. `/media/<key>` is now served by Express for the `local` driver (`server.js`, guarded by `STORAGE_DRIVER==='local'`, excluded from the SPA fallback; Vite proxies `/media` in dev). Proven by the white-label logo upload (`POST /api/tenant/branding/logo` → `storage.put` → tenant-namespaced key under `./data/vault/tenant_<slug>/branding/…`). ~~**Still TODO for the vault:** an **auth-gated** download route for _sensitive_ documents~~ — **the route now exists**: `GET /documents/:id/download` behind `requirePermission(MODULE,"view")` (`document_vault.routes.js:15`). **But the hole it was meant to close is still open** (2026-08-01): `src/server.js:99` still mounts `express.static` on `/media` over the whole `STORAGE_LOCAL_PATH` root, and the vault writes confidential PDFs under that same root — so anyone who knows or guesses a key bypasses the gate. Narrow the mount to public prefixes (branding / entity logos) or move the vault outside it.
  - **S3 driver — IMPLEMENTED 2026-07-22:** `storage.service.js` now ships two interchangeable drivers behind `STORAGE_DRIVER` (`local` | `s3`). The `s3` driver targets any S3-compatible store (AWS S3, MinIO, Wasabi, B2, Cloudflare R2) via `S3_ENDPOINT` / `S3_BUCKET` / `S3_REGION` / `S3_ACCESS_KEY` / `S3_SECRET_KEY` / `S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE` (all in `env.js`), with an optional `CDN_BASE_URL` for public URLs and a `signedUrl(key, ttl)` for temporary access (presigned GET). The AWS SDK (`@aws-sdk/client-s3`, `@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner`) is **lazily required** so `local` deployments don't need it installed — run `npm install` (both are now in `package.json`) before setting `STORAGE_DRIVER=s3`. Interface (`put`/`get`/`delete`/`publicUrl`/`signedUrl`) is unchanged, so no module edits were needed. NB this supersedes the PRD §8 "self-hosted, no S3" line — S3 is now an opt-in deployment choice, local stays the default.
- [x] Email/SMTP service — per-tenant SMTP from tenant `setting` (refactored 2026 by colleague), queued sends via jobs; SPF/DKIM/DMARC domain setup stays an ops/DNS open item (see open questions)

## Phase 2 — Commercial cycle

> **Audit 2026-07-12 (post-colleague-merge).** Commercial cycle is largely landed

- [x] Master data: corporate entities, employees, client master (KYC, credit limit), supplier master (mobile money) — `master/{corporate_entity,employees,client_master,supplier_master}/`
- [x] Currency & live FX — `master/currency/` (40 ln) + FX job; per-transaction stamped rate + manual override
- [x] Operations File Registry (dossier) + service_type taxonomy — `operations/operations_file/` (82 ln)
- [x] Milestone engine: versioned templates → instances — `operations/milestone/` (74 ln, versioned templates per colleague's `df1a2ea`)
- [~] Operations-File 360° modal — backend surfaces exist (milestones/people/money/documents/comms); the combined **FE modal** lands with the Lovable reskin
- [x] Transit orders, delivery notes — `operations/{transit_order,delivery_note}/`
- [x] Project costing (ledger-posting, dossier-tagged), cost tracking, disbursal (régie state machine) — `costing/{costing,cost_tracking,cash_request,regie}/`
- [x] Margin Simulator / Extra-Charges Simulator (no GL impact) — `commercial/{margin_simulation,extra_charge_simulation}/`
- [x] Proforma & advance-payment invoices (advance → 4191) — `finance/proforma/` (52 ln)
- [x] Final invoice (revenue recognition, clears advance + débours) — `finance/final_invoice/` (152 ln, `final-invoice-lifecycle.test.js`)
- [x] Smart Receivables Ledger (ageing, allocations, reminders) — `finance/smart_receivables/` (112 ln)
- [x] Procurement: purchase requests → POs → goods received (three-way match) + supplier invoice — `procurement/{purchase_request,purchase_order,goods_received,supplier_invoice}/`

## Phase 3 — People & assets

- [x] HR (ledger-independent): vacancies+applicants (MOD-11), contracts (MOD-12), KPI appraisals (MOD-13), attendance (MOD-14), leave/allowances (MOD-15), SOPs (MOD-16), trainings+roster (MOD-18), talent pool (MOD-19) — **the "remaining" three are now built too** (2026-08-01 audit): onboarding checklists = `src/modules/hr/onboarding/` (MOD-16), succession = `src/modules/hr/succession/` (MOD-19), both added session 15; employee self-service = `client/src/features/hr/my-hr.tsx`. Also since: `hr/hr_query` + `hr/hr_sanction` (discipline, `0475_hr_discipline_and_avatar`).
- [x] Payroll: CNPS + IRPP/CAC/CFC/RAV auto-compute, payslip generation, auto-posted payroll journal, SoD via run states — **BUILT (verified 2026-08-01, this line said "deferred" for weeks).** `src/modules/hr/payroll/payroll.service.js` computes via `payroll.rules.computePayslip` and posts a balanced journal on validation (661/664 debit; 431/447/422 credit) through `journal_entry.service`. If the ledger isn't configured (no journal/period/accounts) the run records without posting rather than failing. FE at `client/src/features/hr/payroll.tsx`.
- [x] Fleet: vehicle registry (MOD-39), compliance & renewal alerts (MOD-40), maintenance/work orders (MOD-41), dispatch (MOD-42), fuel tracking (MOD-43), driver management (MOD-44), incident/claim tracking (MOD-45) — _fuel/work-order GL posting deferred to Phase 1_
- [x] Warehouse (WMS): inbound/GRN + QA hold + putaway (MOD-33), location management (MOD-34), inventory control + stock-movement journal (MOD-35), outbound pick/pack/dispatch (MOD-36), equipment handling (MOD-37), cycle counting (MOD-38)
- [x] Asset management: acquisition → depreciation (auto-posting) → disposal — **BUILT (verified 2026-08-01).** Full 7-file module at `src/modules/finance/asset/` (repo/service/controller/routes/validator/events/ai + `asset.rules.js` for the depreciation schedule). Same correction as payroll: this said "deferred" long after it landed.

## Phase 4 — Intelligence & reach

> **Audit 2026-07-12.** Partially landed by the colleague's AI merges
> (`45b1bc1` batch AI actions + transcribe/vision jobs, `03593d5` DB-first vendor
> resolution + env fallback). AI spine and governance exist; portals/comms/reporting
> are backend-scaffold or pending FE.

- [x] AI service layer — DB-first vendor resolution + env fallback, transcribe (Groq) + vision (Gemini) jobs, batch action processing (`ai/`, `src/services/ai/*`, `jobs/handlers/ai-*`); per-tenant AI toggle in settings. **Spend dashboard is built** (verified 2026-08-01): `client/src/features/ai-control/pages.tsx` has both a Spend caps editor (soft warn / hard block) and a Usage table off `/ai/governance/usage`. **Vendor keys moved to the platform in session 16** — they are now one shared deploy-wide set (`platform/0060_ai_vendor`), managed in the console under Integrations → AI providers; the tenant Vendors tab was removed.
- [x] Zod validation gate for AI actions + action-card confirmation flow — `src/services/ai/action-registrar.js` + batch confirm (`action-registrar.test.js`, batch-confirm tests)
- [x] AI governance: usage caps, PII/financial redaction, full AI-call logging — `ai/governance/` (148 ln)
- [x] Pricing Variance Index (R/Y/G, no raw cost exposure) — `commercial/pricing_variance/` (52 ln)
- [~] Portals: Client / Investor / Audit Terminal — `portal/` backend (staff grant + scoped views) **plus external-user auth (2026-07-22, new `portal_auth/` module + migration `0460_portal_user.sql`)**: public `POST /portal/auth/login` issues a portal-scoped JWT (`typ:"portal"`, off the RBAC path); `portalAuth(type)` re-checks the `portal_access` grant per request (revoke takes effect immediately) and injects the scope; `GET /portal/{me,client,investor,auditor}` reuse `portal.service`'s scoped views; staff invite/manage external users via `MOD-67`-gated `/portal/users`. **Apply migration 0460 to each tenant (live+sandbox) before use.** **FE portals (the external-facing pages) still pending.**
- [~] Support & Feedback dashboard (ticket lifecycle, PRD §11.2) — **BE + platform-console triage built (2026-07-23)**. Central `platform.support_ticket` (already in `0030_platform_ops.sql`) is the store — no cross-tenant fan-out. Tenant-side API: new `src/modules/dashboard/support/` (ungated, `authMiddleware`) — `POST/GET /api/tenant/support/tickets`, `GET /tickets/:id`, `POST /tickets/:id/csat` (CSAT only on SHIPPED/DECLINED), scoped to `req.tenant.tenant_id`, stamped with `req.user.email`, written to the platform DB via `services/platform/db`. Platform-side: `services/platform/support.service.js` + `GET /api/platform/support/tickets` (aggregate across tenants + `?status/kind/tenant` filters), `GET /tickets/:id`, `PATCH /tickets/:id` status transition (audited `support.status_changed`). Console **Support** tab is now a live triage board (lanes by status, filters, per-ticket detail + transitions). **Tenant-app FE built too** — `client/src/features/support/support-page.tsx` (route `/support`, nav under Overview): raise a ticket (kind/title/body), track status, and rate resolved tickets (CSAT). Full loop is complete. **Not yet run against a live API** (Windows `npm run lint`/`test`/`build` + a click-through owed, per the usual rule).
- [~] Smart Comms Portal — **the calls programme is built end to end** (PRD §4.4/§4.6/§4.8; guide `doc/SMART_COMMS_CALLS_ENGINEERING_GUIDE.md` is the as-built record). *PR-1:* 1:1 WebRTC calls over the comms socket — membership-checked state machine (`smartcomm.call.service.js`), per-user TURN credentials (`smartcomm.turn.service.js`), migration `14000`, the call overlay in `/comms`. *PR-2:* recording → transcription → summary (`smartcomm.call.pipeline.service.js`, `14010`) with §4.5's never-silently-degrade rule: a fallback capture is flagged on the transcript AND on the screen. *PR-3:* RNNoise on the outbound track (`client/src/features/comms/call/noise-suppression.ts`; three-state per-user preference + tenant default in `comms.call_noise_suppression`), ring escalation as a delayed job (`comms-call-ring-escalate`) that re-reads the row and stands down on any ack, `call:ring_ack` over socket/notification/push, ICE recovery (`disconnected` arms a 10 s window, then one ICE restart; `playoutDelayHint` from measured RTT/jitter), and the ops half — `platform.comms_call_metric` (`0107`), `GET /api/platform/ops/comms/calls`, console `/ops/comms`, alert `comms.transcription_sustained` at the failure RATE. Screens: `/comms` (overlay + `/comms/calls` audio tab) and `/settings/calls` (company default + the person's own choice).
  **One caveat, stated rather than buried.** The standing device matrix — `doc/SMART_COMMS_CALLS_MANUAL_MATRIX.md`, iOS PWA reference device + Android + desktop — is committed with **every row `PENDING`**: the before/after noise listening test on the yard clip is a HUMAN check and has not been performed here, so this entry is `[~]`, not `[x]`. On the flags: **no switch-on is outstanding** — `calls` and `call_recording` are ON by default by the guide's locked decision (§1 row 2: the flag is the tenant's kill switch), carried by the platform catalogue seeds `9134`/`9135` (default_state on, included in all plans) plus the tenant `feature_state` seeds, and verified projected `on` in both `live` and `sandbox` on a provisioned tenant. The guide's older §3.1 sentence claiming "off by default, on for Smart Logistics" was wrong and has been corrected in place.
  Still open beyond calls: certified export is a backend route with no screen (`POST /smartcomm/channels/:id/certify`); external customer channels (WhatsApp/Instagram) were cut from Comms deliberately — `client/src/features/comms/external-channel.tsx` is an empty tombstone.
- [~] Reporting & Insights dashboards — `vault/report/` is real (saved reports, dashboard tiles, schedules) and the FE ships at `/vault/reports`. **Export is still PDF-only**: `report.validator.js:5` accepts `pdf|csv|xlsx` and `jobs/handlers/scheduled-report.js` honours the schedule, but only `jobs/handlers/pdf-render.js` exists — nothing emits xlsx or csv. Picking a writer (SheetJS/exceljs) is the open call.
- [x] Settings module (MOD-70): configuration hub — **effectively done.** `security/setting`, `security/numbering_setting`, `branding/`, the generic `/settings/:section/:key` store and the tile screens (`config-pages.tsx`, `store-pages.tsx`, `master-data-pages.tsx`, `catalogue-page.tsx`, `document-templates-page.tsx`) all ship under `settings-hub.tsx`. **Only `factory languages` remains** — it is the single tile with no backing endpoint. (Help center, long listed alongside it, is built: `client/src/features/help/help-page.tsx`.)

## Phase 5 — Hardening & migration

- [~] Security: dependency + secret scanning in CI, penetration test, OWASP ASVS L2 pass — **CI scanning added 2026-08-01** (`.github/workflows/ci.yaml`: `npm audit` at high severity, a secret scan, and a duplicate-migration-number guard; plus the client + platform-console builds, which CI never ran before, so a FE break could not fail the pipeline). Pen test and ASVS L2 still not started.
- [ ] Performance: load-test to target concurrency (confirm real user counts with client), p95 API < 400ms on standard reads
- [ ] Backup/DR: automated daily encrypted backups of every tenant's full Postgres database + the platform database, shipped to Google Drive/OneDrive initially (path to S3 later), monthly restore-test drills, WAL-based PITR for finance data
- [ ] Data migration tooling: MySQL → PostgreSQL, core financial/master data re-modelled and de-duplicated, staging reconciliation, client sign-off before cutover (client-owned, post-build)
- [ ] Go-live: Platform Root Admin marks tenant Live, Test/Live toggle hidden from tenant users

## Open questions to resolve before/during build

- [ ] Per-tenant encryption keys: mint per tenant vs. hashed-in-DB (not settled)
- [ ] Maps provider: free-tier now, migrate to Google Maps later — provider TBD
- [ ] "Validate Invoice" vs "Approve Invoice": one combined event or two in the Universal Event System
- [ ] Finalize pricing/setup process for the tenant-owned-Postgres-access add-on (isolation itself is now default — one DB per tenant; this open item is only about handing the tenant admin credentials to their own instance, indicative ~2–3M XAF setup + ~500k/yr)
- [ ] Real concurrent-user counts (now and 2-year) to finalise server sizing
- [ ] Each tenant's sending domain + DNS (SPF/DKIM/DMARC) — needed before live email
- [ ] HT-on-top vs TTC as default quote model (recommended: HT-on-top)
- [ ] Whether the Investor terminal needs a true IFRS view or KPIs alone suffice
- [ ] Object-storage provider decision before local disk outgrows capacity
- [ ] Fuel/asset VAT recoverability specifics — verify with the expert-comptable
- [ ] Which tenants get a website package (build-from-scratch vs. connect-existing) and pricing
