# API reference

**GENERATED — do not edit by hand.** `node scripts/generate-api-docs.js`

Closes API F-25. Derived from `doc/api-contract.json`, which `check-api-contract.js` builds by mounting the real routers — so this cannot drift from the code without CI failing. The previous artefact (a Postman collection) covered 19% of the surface and had already drifted; a hand-written spec would have done the same.

## The out-of-band request contract

F-25 called this out specifically: none of it was documented anywhere, and a third-party integrator could not derive it from the routes.

| Header | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Host` | **Selects the tenant.** `<slug>.<app-domain>` reaches that tenant's data. The platform hosts (`localhost`, `api.*`, `admin.*`, the apex) are NOT tenant hosts — a tenant-API request arriving on one now answers `400 WRONG_HOST` (F-4), where it used to answer 500. |
| `X-Praxis-Env: sandbox` | Selects the sandbox schema for BUSINESS data. Honoured only on a tenant that is not live. |
| `X-Request-Id` | Correlation id, echoed on the response and repeated in every error body. Generated if absent; ignored if longer than 64 chars. |
| `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` | Access token (`typ: "access"`). A refresh or 2FA-pending token presented here is refused. |

**Identity always resolves against the LIVE schema**, whatever `X-Praxis-Env` says — so flipping to sandbox changes which business data you see and never logs you out.

## List, filter, sort

| Parameter | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `limit`, `offset` | Page window. `limit` is clamped to 200 and defaults to 50. |
| `q` | Free-text search, where the resource declares a search column. |
| `sort` | `?sort=created_at` ascending, `?sort=-created_at` descending. **Only columns the resource declares as sortable are accepted**; anything else is `422 INVALID_SORT` rather than silently ignored (F-29). |

Unknown filter keys are refused with `422 UNKNOWN_FILTER` on resources that declare their filterable set (F-28). They used to be dropped silently, so `?stat=OPEN` returned the UNFILTERED list and looked like it had worked.

Every list response carries the pre-`LIMIT` total in `X-Total-Count` (F-26).

## Access tiers

**Not published here yet (API F-23 remains open).** `doc/api-contract.json` records the auth/RBAC middleware attached to each individual route, but nearly every router applies authentication once with `router.use(authMiddleware)`, which does not appear on the route itself. Classifying tiers off those flags produces an answer that is badly wrong (it reports almost the entire surface as public), and a security tier table that lies is worse than none. Deriving it correctly requires resolving router-level middleware in `check-api-contract.js` so that CI and this document share one answer.

What IS true and worth stating: 61 authenticated routes carry no `requirePermission` and are self-scoped by construction (`/notifications/*`, `/workspace`, `/sessions/mine`, `/ai/*`, the seven `/{resource}/mine` endpoints, `/auth/*`), and 10 routes are unauthenticated by design — each reviewed under F-24. Until the tier is machine-derived, `doc/API_CONTRACT_AUDIT.md` §F-23/F-24 is the reference for both lists.
