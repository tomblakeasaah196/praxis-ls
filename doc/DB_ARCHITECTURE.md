# Praxis LS — Database Architecture & Schema Design

**Status:** Design of record for the data layer. Read alongside the PRD (Master Functional Spec v2), the OHADA/Tax Knowledge Base (governs all accounting behaviour), and the kickoff transcript (authoritative on tenancy).
**Owner:** JBS Praxis engineering.
**Scope:** how tenants are isolated, how *everything* is configured from the platform console (never by editing a tenant DB), how the accounting engine is modelled, and how AI vectorization is stored.

## 0. Reading guide

Where the source documents disagree, this file records the decision taken and why. Two disagreements are resolved up front:

1. **Tenancy.** PRD §5.3 says *schema-per-tenant*; the kickoff (Decision D5) and `WORK_TO_BE_DONE.md` say *one physical Postgres database per tenant*. **The kickoff decision governs** — it is later and it is load-bearing for the commercial model ("we hold the code, they hold the data"; a tenant can be sold access to their own Postgres). See §1.
2. **AI grounding.** PRD §5.8/10.1 say "no RAG / no vector store." **Per the product owner, vectorization is kept** — embeddings live per-tenant and are gated by the AI EMV toggle. Function-calling and vector recall coexist: function-calling for authoritative record fetches, vectors for semantic search/recall over the tenant's own corpus. See §7.

Naming: `snake_case` everywhere, surrogate PK `<entity>_id uuid default gen_random_uuid()`, `created_at/updated_at timestamptz default now()`, money as `numeric(18,2)`, rates as `numeric(9,4)`. Plain `pg` + parameterised SQL, no ORM (PRD §5.2). Every statutory-account and tax value is *data*, never a literal in code.

```

- **One platform database** holds the tenant registry and everything the **Praxis company dashboard** controls: who exists, their subdomain, which plan, which modules/features are switched on, provisioning state, billing, support tickets. **Tenants never see this DB**; platform users never see tenant business rows (PRD §5.3 [RULE]).
- **One physical Postgres database per tenant.** Strongest isolation (cross-tenant access impossible by construction), trivial per-tenant encrypted backup/restore (kickoff §10), and it is the only model that lets a tenant be handed credentials to *their own* Postgres (the ~2–3M XAF add-on, kickoff §5).
- **Live vs Sandbox** live **inside each tenant's Postgres as two schemas**: `live` and `sandbox`, identical structure. The top-bar Test/Live toggle switches `search_path`. A cron truncates+reseeds `sandbox` every 14 days (configurable). The wipe can never touch `live` (different schema, different sequences). This keeps sandbox data inside the tenant's own isolation boundary — no cross-tenant bleed (kickoff §6).
- **Request resolution:** subdomain → `platform.tenant`/`tenant_database` → a pooled connection to that tenant DB with `search_path = {live|sandbox}`. **[RULE]** No business query runs without a resolved tenant connection; platform-tier endpoints use the platform pool only.
- **Connection management** replaces today's single shared `pg.Pool`. A registry/manager keeps one small pool **per tenant DB**, opened lazily and capped; the current `app.current_business` RLS-by-column approach (Pixie Girl carryover) is removed — isolation is now the database boundary, not a row filter.

### Why not schema-per-tenant or RLS
Schema-per-tenant is simpler to operate but cannot cleanly hand a tenant their own DB (they'd be inside the shared cluster). RLS-by-column (current code) is the weakest: a single missing predicate leaks across tenants, and it makes "your data, your Postgres" impossible. DB-per-tenant costs more ops effort, which the documented scaling ladder already funds (1 box → split servers at 5–10 tenants → PgBouncer at 10+).

## 2. The core principle: configuration lives in data, driven from the platform console

The transcript is unambiguous (Blake, §3, §11.14): org charts, approval chains, services, milestones, allowances, chart of accounts, roles, tax rates — **none hard-coded, all per-tenant configuration**. The product owner's added constraint: **"we never come to the DB to configure for any tenant"** — all of it, including adding/removing features, is done from the **Praxis company dashboard**, which is a different application surface from the tenant's own Settings UI.

That yields a consistent shape across the whole schema:

> **A config layer (rows, editable) feeds an execution layer (append-only, invariant-guarded).**

| Concern | Config layer (data) | Execution layer |
|---|---|---|
| Access | `role`, `capability`, `scope`, `permission`, `field_visibility` | every endpoint/field resolver checks it |
| Workflow | `event_type`, `workflow`, `workflow_step` (validate→approve chains) | `approval_task` instances |
| Accounting | `chart_of_accounts`, `dictionary_item`, `posting_rule`, `tax_code` | `journal_entry`/`journal_line` |
| Operations | `service_type`, `milestone_template` | `dossier`, `milestone_instance` |
| Features | platform `feature_catalogue` + `plan_feature` + `tenant_feature_override` | `feature_state` resolved into each tenant |
| Pay | `allowance_type`, `payroll_component` | `payroll_run`/`payroll_run_item` |

### Two tiers of "who configures what"
1. **Platform (Praxis) tier — company dashboard, platform DB.** Provision a tenant, assign subdomain + database, pick plan, **switch module groups and features on/off**, set capacity/limits, mark Live. Feature/module changes are written in the platform DB and **projected into the tenant DB** as `feature_state` rows (via the provisioning/sync worker), so the tenant app reads a local, fast table and Praxis retains central control. Removing a feature flips its state to `off` (data preserved, UI + API gated) — never a `DROP`.
2. **Tenant tier — the tenant's own Settings UI, tenant DB.** The Tenant Super Admin tunes *within* what the plan enables: their org chart, roles, approval chains, COA sub-accounts, dictionary items, tax jurisdictions, milestone templates, branding. They cannot enable a feature their plan doesn't include.

**No schema migration is ever required to onboard a tenant or change their configuration.** Onboarding = create DB + run the standard migration set + seed reference data (COA, tax codes, default roles, event catalogue) + project feature state. That is the provisioning tool, not a manual DB session.

## 3. Platform database (what the company dashboard owns)

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `tenant` | one row per client company; slug, legal name, status (`PROVISIONING/LIVE/SUSPENDED`), plan, live flag (hides Test/Live toggle) |
| `tenant_database` | connection registry: host, port, db name, app role, **secret reference** (never the raw password), region, sandbox schema name, capacity tier |
| `subdomain` | `smartls` → tenant; supports rename + custom domains later |
| `plan` / `plan_feature` | commercial plans and which features each includes |
| `module_catalogue` | the 70 modules (MOD-xx), grouped; the master list a plan draws from |
| `feature_catalogue` | switchable capabilities (finer than modules, e.g. `ai.assistant`, `wms.cycle_count`, `fleet`); each has default state + dependencies |
| `tenant_feature_override` | per-tenant on/off that overrides the plan (the dashboard toggle) |
| `platform_user` | Praxis-side staff; role `PLATFORM_ROOT_ADMIN`; **never** granted tenant business access |
| `platform_audit` | append-only log of every provisioning / feature / suspension action (Watch-the-Watcher at platform level) |
| `provisioning_job` | async create-DB → migrate → seed → project-features pipeline, with state + logs |
| `support_ticket` | tenant→Praxis tickets/feedback, kanban `NEW→TRIAGED→IN_PROGRESS→SHIPPED/DECLINED` (PRD §11.2), feeds the roadmap |
| `tenant_smtp` / `tenant_branding` (light mirror) | onboarding-time brand + sender identity Praxis pre-loads; the authoritative copy lives in the tenant DB Settings |

Feature/module changes here are **projected** into each tenant DB's `feature_state`; the tenant app never queries the platform DB at request time.

## 4. Tenant database — the dynamic engine

### 4.1 Identity, entities, environments
- `corporate_entity` — multi-entity within a tenant (MOD-01): NIU/TIN, RCCM, address, logo, own books. Journals, master data and statements are entity-scoped; inter-company via class 18.
- `app_user`, `user_entity_scope` — users and which entity/branch they belong to.
- Environment is the **schema** (`live`/`sandbox`), not a column — so a sandbox wipe is a `TRUNCATE`/schema reset, and numbering sequences are physically separate.

### 4.2 RBAC as data (MOD-67; fixes "permissions modelled three ways")
- `role` (job area — configurable, not an enum), `capability` (`ISSUER/VALIDATOR/APPROVER` — the authority overlay), `scope` (entity/branch/department).
- `permission` (role × module × CRUD flags), `field_visibility` (role/capability × sensitive field → visible/masked — margins, salaries, supplier cost rates, GL).
- `user_role`, `user_capability`, `user_scope` assignments.
- **Line Manager** is a capability layered on any role, not a standalone role.
- Enforcement is server-side on every endpoint and field resolver; UI only reflects it. Any permission/role/capability/field change emits a high-priority immutable event and notifies CEO/Management (Watch-the-Watcher, PRD §5.7); in Live, a Super Admin cannot self-grant Issuer/Validator/Approver (maker-checker).

### 4.3 Universal Event System + workflow designer (MOD-67/§11.14)
- `event_type` — standardised `entity.action` (`invoice.issued`, `costing.approved`, `permission.changed`, `vehicle.insurance.expiring`, `advance.aged_unjustified`). Modules **register** their events, so new modules auto-appear in workflow/notification config.
- `workflow` + `workflow_step` — per event, per tenant: an ordered chain of validate/approve steps, each bound to a role/capability/scope and optionally an amount threshold. This is the **no-code approval-chain designer** (team A validates → team B approves → CEO by value). Add validators to lengthen the chain.
- `event_log` (append-only) → drives notifications, the compliance layer, dashboard/portal live updates, and feeds the immutable ledger.
- `approval_task` — the runtime instances awaiting a specific user ("approvals waiting on me").
- The **same event+schema layer** gates AI actions: an AI-proposed action is a candidate `event` validated against its Zod/`payload_schema` before a human confirms (PRD §10.3).

### 4.4 Feature state, numbering, settings, immutable ledger
- `feature_state` — the projection of platform feature decisions (fast local read; the tenant app gates modules/AI on this). Read-only to the tenant.
- `doc_sequence` (`module_key, year, seq`) — numbering `{PREFIX}-{MODULE}-{YYYY}-{NNNN}`, allocated only on issue/lock, gap-audited; **separate per schema** so sandbox never burns Live numbers.
- `setting` — tenant Settings (appearance/white-label, legal identity, workflow config, finance/tax config, comms/email, integrations, feature prefs), versioned; pushes to the running app with no redeploy (MOD-70).
- `immutable_ledger` — append-only `{actor, role, action, module, entity_ref, before_hash, after_hash, payload_json, ip, created_at}`. Every create/update/lock/post/reverse/delete/restore, every permission change, every God-Mode action, every AI action. 10-year retention. Read-only to the Audit Terminal. **Never hard-deleted, not even by God Mode.**

### 4.5 Deletion / immutability policy (PRD §8.5)
- Non-accounting master/operational data: **soft-delete**; restore needs a second admin (maker-checker); both logged.
- Accounting-connected data: **never deletable** — only reversed by a reason-bearing reversal that is itself posted/locked/logged.
- God Mode (CEO + PIN): purges junk non-accounting data only; **refuses ledger-connected records**; writes the full removed payload to the immutable ledger.

## 5. Accounting engine (KB governs; §4, §22, §23)

The three layers stay **separate** (never merge COA and Dictionary):

1. `chart_of_accounts` — statutory SYSCOHADA, hierarchical (`code`, `parent_code`, `class 1–9`, `normal_balance D/C`, `is_postable`, `requires_analytic`). Seeded per tenant/entity; core is regulated, tenants add sub-accounts. Creating a treasury sub-account (a new bank/MoMo wallet) auto-creates the matching COA sub-account (transcript §11.3f).
2. `dictionary_item` — operational, user-editable catalogue (friendly EN/FR names, category, **`is_debours`**, price/currency/shipping-line). What operators and AI interact with.
3. `posting_rule` — the glue: dict item → debit/credit account(s) + `tax_code` + context (`sale/purchase/disbursement`). **[RULE]** a dictionary item cannot be saved without a complete rule.
4. `tax_jurisdiction` / `tax_code` — **versioned** with `effective_from/to` (never overwrite): TVA 19.25%, WHT 2.2%/5.5%, IS 33%/min 2.2%/5.5%, CNPS, CFC, FNE, IRPP brackets, CAC. Postings use the version effective at the entry date.

Execution layer:
- `journal` (Achats/Ventes/Banque/Paie/OD), `journal_entry` (`entry_no` gap-free per journal/period, `status draft|validated`, `source SYSTEM_AUTO|SYSTEM_RULE|HUMAN_MANUAL|HUMAN_CORRECTION`, `review_status UNREVIEWED|ATTESTED|FLAGGED|CORRECTED`, `corrects_entry_id`, `source_doc_ref`, `period_id`), `journal_line` (`account_code`, exactly one of debit/credit > 0, **`dossier_id`** analytical dimension, `tax_code`, `currency`, `fx_rate`).
- `accounting_period` — freeze/lock; validated entries immutable; corrections = reversal+replacement (never edit in place).
- `regie_advance` (581 state machine `ISSUED→PARTIALLY_JUSTIFIED→JUSTIFIED`, `AGED_UNJUSTIFIED`, `QUERIED`) — aging auto-reclassifies 581→4211, never auto-allocates to 4731 (KB §6.8).
- Invoicing: `advance` (4191), `invoice`/`invoice_line` (proforma/final; `is_debours` per line), receivables/allocations, assets/depreciation.

**The KB §23 invariants are enforced in the DB** where possible (CHECK constraints + triggers): balanced entries (Σ Dr = Σ Cr), one side per line, postable-leaf-only, débours never in class 6/7, no VAT on débours, no compensation, advance≠revenue, gap-free `entry_no`, analytical completeness on 4731/706/707/direct-cost lines, immutability of validated entries, tax-code versioning, dictionary completeness. These are encoded as triggers so a bad write is rejected regardless of which service issues it.

---

## 6. Operations, HR, procurement, WMS, fleet, vault
Modelled as config→execution the same way: `service_type`/`service_territory` taxonomy → `dossier` (the operations file, the cost object) → `milestone_template` (versioned per service_type) → `milestone_instance` (insertable between two, auto-recalculating due dates); costing→ledger tagged `dossier_id`; procurement PR→PO→GRN three-way match; payroll `allowance_type`/component config → `payroll_run` (state machine) auto-posting the payroll journal; fleet/WMS registries with alert events; `document_vault` with content hash + QR + 10-year retention + compliance checker flags. Lighter modules are scaffolded now (own the tables) and deepened per phase.

---

## 7. AI vectorization (kept, per product owner)
- `ai_document` / `ai_chunk` (with `embedding vector(N)` via pgvector) — per-tenant semantic corpus (dossiers, docs, messages, dictionary). Lives **inside the tenant DB**, so embeddings never cross tenants.
- `ai_conversation` / `ai_message` / `ai_action_run` — assistant sessions and the Zod-gated action runs (proposed → validated → confirmed → executed), each logged to the immutable ledger.
- Governance (`ai_feature_flag`, `ai_access_grant`, `ai_vendor_credential` [encrypted keys], `ai_budget_period`, `ai_usage_ledger`, `ai_action_catalogue`): re-homed from the Pixie Girl `shared.*` schema into the tenant schema, costs in **XAF** (not NGN), gated by the two-part EMV toggle (front-end UI + back-end action) resolved from `feature_state`. Provider routing DeepSeek→Gemini, Whisper/Groq for voice. **PII/financial redaction before any external call.**
- Vectors complement function-calling: function-calling fetches the exact authoritative record with the user's permissions; vectors provide semantic recall over the tenant's own corpus. Both respect field-level confidentiality.

---

## 8. Migration & folder layout
```
migrations/
  platform/     0001_extensions … platform DB (company dashboard)
  tenant/       0001_extensions … per-tenant DB (run for every tenant, live+sandbox)
  seeds/        OHADA COA, Cameroon tax codes, default RBAC, event catalogue, module/feature catalogue
```
Migrations are versioned and idempotent-friendly; the provisioning tool runs `tenant/*` against each new tenant DB (both schemas) then applies `seeds/*`. Platform migrations run once for the cluster.
