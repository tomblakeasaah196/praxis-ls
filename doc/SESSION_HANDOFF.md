# Praxis LS — Session Handoff

Paste-in context for a fresh session, plus a running record of the FE reskin work.
Companion to `doc/WORK_DONE.md` (full history) and `doc/WORK_TO_BE_DONE.md` (backlog).

_Last updated: 2026-07-13 (end of day) — session focus: FE landing→login flow + top-bar navigation._

## Project

Praxis LS (SmartLS) — multi-tenant OHADA/Cameroon logistics + accounting ERP.
- **Backend:** Node 20 CommonJS + Express + PostgreSQL 16/pgvector + Redis. Repo root.
- **Frontend:** Vite + React 18 + TS SPA in `client/`.
- **Working folder:** `C:\Users\Grey\Documents\work\praxiz\praxis-ls`.

## Read first

`doc/WORK_DONE.md` (newest on top), `doc/WORK_TO_BE_DONE.md` (phase backlog with dated
audit banners), `doc/CONVENTIONS.md`, `doc/BUILD_CONVENTIONS.md`, `doc/AI_READINESS.md`.
Design reference: `doc/reference/reference-mock-lovable`.

## Current state

- **Backend Phases 0–4 substantially built** (colleague merged Phases 1–2; Phase 3
  Fleet/WMS/HR built here). Tests + lint green.
- **Frontend reskinned to the Lovable "Control Tower" look**, keeping the existing
  client's working plumbing (auth, api-client with refresh-on-401, branding, theme,
  screen-registry). Approach chosen with the user: *functionality of the existing
  client, looks of Lovable.*
  - `client/src/index.css` — Lovable design tokens (orange `#F5821F` + blue `#1C9BD7`,
    off-white/navy palette, Playfair Display + Montserrat, mesh backdrop) mapped onto
    the existing semantic tokens, so every screen re-tints automatically. Signature
    classes: `lux-card`, `status` pills, `lux-topbar`, `lux-mark`, `lux-navlink`,
    `font-display`. Now also carries a `landing-*` / `login-*` block (cinematic hero +
    dark sign-in modal, fully `--primary`-driven) and `.shadow-l` + `.lux-sidebar-in`.
  - `client/index.html` — Google Fonts links.
  - `client/src/app/layout/app-shell.tsx` — glass top command bar. **Navigation moved
    into the top bar (2026-07-13):** primary areas inline (Control Tower link +
    Finance/Warehouse/Fleet dropdowns), a **More** button opens the full menu (all 7
    groups) as a collapsible **overlay sidebar** (ESC / outside-click to close). The old
    persistent left rail is gone; content is full-width. Mobile hamburger opens the same
    sidebar. **LIVE/TEST toggle** kept (flips `X-Praxis-Env` and reloads). ⌘K search
    affordance currently opens the sidebar (no real command palette yet).
  - `client/src/features/dashboard.tsx` — Control Tower home renders the **full Lovable
    mock** in an isolated `<iframe srcDoc>` from `client/src/features/dashboard-mock/*.txt`.
    The mock's own topbar is hidden so there's a single app chrome; the iframe's
    `data-theme` tracks the app's light/dark via a MutationObserver.
- **Pre-auth experience rebuilt (2026-07-13): cinematic landing → login modal.**
  - `client/src/features/landing/landing-page.tsx` (NEW) — the `/login` route now renders
    a full-bleed dark hero (ken-burns bg, logo + theme toggle, eyebrow, serif headline,
    subheadline, italic body, brand chips, **Enter workspace** button). Fully white-label:
    hero content comes from the tenant branding; blank fields fall back to generic copy
    derived from the brand name. Every accent is `--primary` (token-driven crimson/orange).
  - `client/src/features/auth/login-modal.tsx` (NEW) — "Welcome back / Sign in to your
    command center" modal over the dimmed hero. **PASSWORD | QUICK PIN** tabs, email +
    password (reveal), keep-me-signed-in, forgot-password, SIGN IN; the existing **2FA**
    step is retained after password. Quick PIN is a **UI stub** (no backend endpoint yet).
  - `client/src/features/auth/login-page.tsx` — now a thin re-export of `LandingPage`
    (superseded; old standalone login removed).
  - `client/src/lib/branding.ts` — `Branding` extended with an optional `hero` block
    (eyebrow / headline / subheadline / body / imageUrl / pills[]) + `BrandPill`.
    `uploadLogo` renamed to `uploadImage` (alias kept).
  - `client/src/features/settings/appearance-page.tsx` — new **"Landing page"** card to
    edit all hero fields, upload the background image, and manage brand chips; saves via
    the existing `PUT /branding` flow and applies live.
  - **Keep-me-signed-in is real:** `client/src/lib/token-store.ts` now stores the refresh
    token in `localStorage` when checked (survives restart) or `sessionStorage` when
    unchecked (gone when the tab closes); `auth-context.login(email, pw, keepSignedIn)`
    threads the choice (also covers the 2FA path).
- **Phase 0 + Phase 1 FE wired to live endpoints.** Finance screens in
  `client/src/features/finance/pages.tsx` (Chart of accounts, Journals, Proforma &
  advances, Invoices, Receivables, tabbed Statements, tabbed Tax center, Assets), routed
  in `client/src/app/app.tsx` + nav + `client/src/app/screen-registry.json`. HR
  Employees/Payroll wired by colleague. Finance write forms (post/reverse journal, record
  advance, invoice draft→edit→submit, period freeze/close) via `ui/modal.tsx` +
  `lib/finance-api.ts`.
- **Auth behaviour:** logout `localStorage.clear()`s everything — nothing persists across
  sign-out (until told otherwise).
- **Postman** `postman/praxis-ls.phase0.postman_collection.json` — Phase 0 + Finance +
  Fleet/WMS/HR folders.

## Session log — 2026-07-13 (FE)

1. **Landing → login flow** replicated from a screen recording ("The Pixie Hub" concept).
   Decisions taken with the user: data-driven white-label (Pixie is sample data);
   token-driven crimson via `--primary`; keep 2FA; wire keep-me-signed-in; Quick PIN as a
   UI stub; hero assets/copy authored on the Appearance screen. Files: `landing-page.tsx`,
   `login-modal.tsx`, `branding.ts`, `appearance-page.tsx`, `token-store.ts`,
   `auth-context.tsx`, `icons.tsx`, `index.css`, `app.tsx` route.
2. **Control-panel nav moved to the top bar** (Lovable pattern): Control Tower / Finance /
   Warehouse / Fleet inline (areas open dropdowns), **More** opens a full-menu collapsible
   overlay sidebar; left rail removed. File: `app-shell.tsx` (+ `index.css`).

`tsc --noEmit` on `client/` passes clean for both pieces.

## First thing to do in a new session

Run these on Windows and report/fix results (authoritative validators — the sandbox bash
mount is unreliable for freshly-written files; see **Sandbox gotcha** below):

```
npm run lint
npm test
npm run build --prefix client
```

To preview the app: `npm run dev` (backend, repo root) + `cd client && npm run dev`
(Vite). Set `VITE_TENANT_HOST` to the provisioned tenant (e.g. `smartls.praxisls.com`).
Check the new `/login` landing + the top-bar nav / More sidebar first.

## Known remaining work / gaps

- **Quick PIN** login tab is a UI stub — needs a backend endpoint (device-bound fast
  unlock) before it does anything.
- **Command palette / mobile bottom nav** not built: the top bar's ⌘K currently opens the
  More sidebar; the Lovable mock also has a mobile bottom nav. Both are follow-ons.
- **Landing hero assets are tenant-authored** via Appearance (image + copy + chips). Blank
  fields fall back to generic copy; the "Pixie Hub" content in the reference video is
  sample data, not shipped defaults.
- **Finance:** still no forms for **tax declaration filing** (Tax Center is GET-only) and
  **credit notes** (`type='CREDIT_NOTE'` in schema, nothing creates one) — both lack a BE
  endpoint.
- Control Tower dashboard is the **static Lovable mock** (sample data in an iframe), not
  live widgets. Feeding tiles from real endpoints is a follow-on.
- Platform console UI and per-tenant PWA manifest still not built (Phase 0 items).
- **Cleanup:** a stray empty `client/src/_wtest.txt` was left from a sandbox write-test
  (the sandbox couldn't delete it); safe to `rm` on Windows.

## Conventions

Modules = 7 files (`repo`/`service`/`controller`/`routes`/`validator`/`events`/`ai.js`);
**SQL only in `.repo.js`**, never in `.service.js`; RBAC-gated routers
(`requirePermission(M, action)`, actions view/create/edit/delete/approve — it's **"edit"
not "update"**); non-README MD files live in `doc/`. Ask before large or destructive
changes.

## Sandbox gotcha

The bash workspace mounts the Windows folder over a network FS whose page cache goes
**stale** for files written via the file tools — it can serve old/**truncated**/NUL-padded
copies, so in-sandbox `node`/`grep`/`jest` on freshly edited files give false failures.
**Confirmed again 2026-07-13:** the file tools (Write/Edit) truncated/NUL-padded several
`.tsx` files on this mount; rewriting them via a bash heredoc (`cat > file <<'EOF'`) writes
reliably (`rm`/unlink is blocked, but `>` truncates fine). Restoring a clean base from git
(`git show HEAD:path > path`) then re-applying is also reliable. Note: `client/package-lock.json`
is Windows-generated, so a Linux `vite build` fails on the missing `@rollup/rollup-linux-x64-gnu`
native binary — that's environmental; a normal `npm install` on Windows fixes it and `tsc`
is the trustworthy in-sandbox check. The real files are correct (Vite/tsc/PowerShell see them
fine). Fix: start a fresh session (remounts clean), or just validate on Windows.
