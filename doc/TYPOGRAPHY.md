# Typography — the font library, the picker, and the two appearance layers

Everything the ERP renders type with is decided by three CSS variables:
`--font-display`, `--font-body`, `--font-mono`. `client/src/index.css` binds
them to `body` and to the ~35 `.font-display` call sites, so setting them once
changes every screen. This document is about who gets to set them, and with
what.

## The library

`client/src/lib/fonts.ts` is the closed set of **seventeen** families the product
ships. All but one are self-hosted through `@fontsource` under SIL OFL or
Apache-2.0, which is the whole point: **what a tenant picks is what every user
renders, on every device.** (The exception is Brittany Signature, a commercial
script vendored under `client/src/fonts` for the email signature card — it is in
`FONTS` but not in the table below, which is why this count and the table's
never quite agreed.)

| Sans                                                                                                                                                | Serif               | Mono                           |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Inter · Roboto · Noto Sans · Plus Jakarta Sans · Archivo · IBM Plex Sans · Work Sans · Open Sans · Public Sans · Montserrat · Source Sans 3 · Lato | Lora · Merriweather | JetBrains Mono · Cascadia Code |

**Archivo** was added for the public web experience: an industrial grotesque with
a 100–900 weight axis, cut for display sizes. The axis is what
`public-web`'s `<WeightScrub>` animates — see
`doc/PUBLIC_WEB_EXPERIENCE_GUIDE.md` §5.5. It is the public site's default
display face; the ERP's default is unchanged.

**Adding a family** means: an `@fontsource` dependency in `client/`, an entry in
`FONTS`, the counts in `client/src/lib/fonts.test.ts` and
`client/src/components/settings/font-picker.test.tsx` (they are pinned so that
adding a face is a deliberate act, not a drive-by), and this table. The root
`scripts/check-fonts.mjs` parses `fonts.ts` for its allow-list, so a family
named anywhere in the tree that is not in that file fails the build.

### Why Segoe UI, SF Pro and Helvetica Neue are not in it

They are proprietary — Microsoft, Apple and Monotype — and cannot be
redistributed. Listing them would mean shipping a name that renders natively on
one OS and silently substitutes on every other, which is the failure this
library exists to end. **Noto Sans, Plus Jakarta Sans and Work Sans** stand in
for them respectively.

Note that the sans fallback stack still leads with `system-ui`, which is the
licence-clean way to reach Segoe UI on Windows and SF Pro on Apple platforms:
the OS picks its own face and nothing is redistributed.

### What is persisted

The **CSS stack string**, not the id — the same value the free-text boxes wrote
before the library existed, so no data migration was needed.
`fontByValue()` resolves a stored string back to a library entry by matching its
first family, which is what makes pre-library data correct rather than merely
preserved: a tenant who typed `"Montserrat", Georgia, serif` now resolves to
Montserrat and loads the real webfont, where before the browser found no
Montserrat installed and quietly rendered Georgia.

A stack that matches nothing is kept and shown as **Custom**. It is never
rewritten — opening a settings screen must not change a setting.

### Loading is lazy, and that is enforced in three places

1. `loadFonts()` pulls only the families the active stacks name — at most three
   of seventeen — and is called from the branding context on every paint.
2. `vite.config.ts` excludes `@fontsource` from the `vendor` bucket, so Rollup
   attaches each family to the dynamic import that pulls it. Left in `vendor`
   they all landed in the eagerly-loaded stylesheet: 96 `@font-face` rules and
   57 kB of render-blocking CSS on every page load.
3. The service worker does **not** precache `woff2`. It used to, which was right
   for one bundled family and became wrong at seventeen — the SW would have
   downloaded 2.8 MB on install for every user to serve the three actually in
   use. Fonts are cached `CacheFirst` at runtime instead, so the offline promise
   still holds for the fonts a user has in force; it is earned on first paint
   rather than prepaid for all seventeen.

Only Inter is in the startup bundle (statically imported by `main.tsx`), because
it is the default every unbranded tenant falls back to.

## The picker

`client/src/components/settings/font-picker.tsx`. A controlled input over one
CSS font-family string — it knows nothing about tenants, users or endpoints, so
the same component serves both editors below without a variant or a flag.

**Every font name renders in its own face.** That is the point of the control,
not a flourish: reading "Merriweather" set in Merriweather tells you what you
are choosing. It is why mounting the picker loads the whole library, and it is
asserted in `font-picker.test.tsx` — if that test ever fails, the control has
degraded into a styled version of the text box it replaced.

Options are grouped Sans / Serif / Monospace via the shared `Select`'s optional
`group` field. Every slot offers all seventeen; the group that suits the slot
leads. There is a collapsed escape hatch for a raw custom stack, for the tenant
who eventually turns up with a licensed corporate typeface on their own CDN.

## Two layers: tenant, then user

|         | Tenant appearance                            | My appearance                    |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Screen  | `/appearance`                                | `/my-appearance`                 |
| Who     | Settings edit (MOD-70)                       | any signed-in user, self-service |
| API     | `PUT /branding`                              | `PUT /me/preferences/appearance` |
| Storage | `setting` (section `appearance`)             | `user_preference` (0496)         |
| Scope   | colours, logos, favicon, type, radius, theme | **type only**                    |

The user layer overrides the tenant's fonts **for that user only**, and follows
them to any device they sign in on. Colour, logo and favicon are deliberately
not user-overridable — those are the company's identity, and letting a user
restyle them means two people on a call disagreeing about what the product looks
like, and support screenshots you cannot trust. The allow-list in
`preference.service.js` is that boundary, and it is tested.

### Precedence

`branding-context.tsx` merges both layers in one place, `resolveFonts()`:
the user's value if set, the tenant's otherwise. Merging at a single point is
what keeps a partial override honest — a user who overrides only the body font
keeps _tracking_ the tenant on display and mono, rather than freezing at
whatever those were the day they saved.

`absent ≠ null` runs the whole way down: an omitted key in a `PUT` is left
alone, an explicit `null` deletes the row and restores inheritance. There is no
third state, and no row ever stores a copy of the tenant's current value.

### Why the personal layer is not applied before login

It cannot be — the server will not say who you are without a token. The login
screen is always the tenant's type, and the user's own takes over on the first
authenticated paint. `UserAppearanceSync` sits inside `AuthProvider` (where both
auth and branding are readable) and pushes the result up. Caching a user's fonts
in `localStorage` to paint them pre-auth was rejected: it paints one person's
preference before you know who is at the keyboard, which is wrong on a shared
terminal.

## The rule, and the gate

**No font from outside the library is named anywhere in the system.** Not in the
UI, not in PDF templates, not in Excel exports, not in email shells, not in the
platform console. `npm run check:fonts` enforces it in CI
(`scripts/check-fonts.mjs`), parsing the allowed list straight out of
`lib/fonts.ts` so the gate can never drift from the library.

It is a grep rather than a lint rule because the failure is not a syntax error.
**A font name that resolves to nothing does not error — it substitutes,
silently.** Nine surfaces were doing exactly that when the gate was written:

| Where                             | Named                                      | Actually rendered                                          |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `index.css` `--font-display/body` | `"InterVariable"`                          | system-ui — the family is `'Inter Variable'`, with a space |
| `index.css` `--font-mono`         | _nothing at all_                           | Tailwind's default: Menlo / Consolas / Courier New         |
| `tailwind.config.ts`              | _no `fontFamily`_                          | `font-mono`/`font-sans` ignored the brand tokens entirely  |
| `excel/workbook.js`               | `Playfair Display`                         | whatever Excel substituted — never shipped                 |
| `pdf.templates.js`                | `'Noto Sans'`, `'Noto Sans Mono'`          | FreeSans — the container installs only `ttf-freefont`      |
| `documents/templates/kit.js`      | `'Noto Sans', 'Segoe UI', Arial`           | FreeSans                                                   |
| 3 × email shells                  | `'Segoe UI', Roboto, Helvetica, Arial`     | recipient's client default                                 |
| `routes/pwa.js` icon              | `Montserrat, Arial`                        | container default                                          |
| `platform-console/styles.css`     | `"Montserrat"`, SF Mono / Menlo / Consolas | OS default — the console bundled no fonts                  |
| `seed-branding.js`                | `Playfair Display` + `Montserrat`          | Georgia + system-ui                                        |

### Fallbacks are bare generic keywords

`sans-serif`, `serif`, `monospace` — nothing else. An earlier draft led the
stacks with `system-ui, -apple-system, Arial`, on the reasoning that `system-ui`
is the licence-clean way to reach Segoe UI and SF Pro. It is, and it still
breaks the promise: `system-ui` resolves to a different typeface per operating
system, which is the per-device inconsistency the library exists to remove.

### Where the guarantee is absolute, and where it is not

| Surface                            | Guarantee                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The ERP UI                         | **Absolute.** Self-hosted woff2, cached on device.                                                                                              |
| Platform console                   | **Absolute.** Same, statically imported.                                                                                                        |
| PDFs (invoices, payslips, reports) | **Absolute.** The woff2 is base64-embedded into each document by `pdf.fonts.js`, so output does not depend on fonts installed in the container. |
| Excel exports                      | **Name only.** The format names a font, it cannot embed one; renders as Montserrat where Montserrat is installed.                               |
| Emails                             | **Name only.** Outlook and most desktop clients ignore `@font-face`; the stack names library faces first over a generic keyword.                |

The last two are format limits, not omissions. Both name library faces
exclusively, which is the most those surfaces can honestly promise.

## Caching — what "works offline" actually means

Fonts are **not** precached. The service worker glob used to include `woff2`,
which was right for one bundled family and wrong at seventeen: it would have
downloaded all 94 files (2.8 MB) on install, for every user, to serve the three
in force. Precache is now 1539 KiB, down from 4197 KiB.

Instead a `CacheFirst` runtime route (`praxis-fonts`, 1 year, 60 entries) stores
each font **the first time it is actually rendered**. So:

- **First ever load on a device** — the font is fetched over the network, on the
  same trip that downloads the app itself. There is no load before this one.
- **Every load after that, online or offline** — served from the device cache.
  Identical rendering, no network.
- **Changing a font** (tenant or personal) — one fetch for the new family, then
  cached like the rest.

## Adding a family

1. `npm i @fontsource-variable/<family>` in `client/`.
2. Add a `FontDef` to `FONTS` in `lib/fonts.ts`. Confirm the declared family
   name from the package's `index.css` — variable packages declare
   `'<Name> Variable'`, **with a space**. Getting this wrong is silent: the app
   downloads the font and renders the fallback, which is exactly what
   `--font-display` did for months by asking for `"InterVariable"`.
3. `fonts.test.ts` asserts the count; update it deliberately.
4. Confirm the family is OFL/Apache-2.0. A font we cannot redistribute does not
   belong in a picker that promises identical rendering everywhere.
5. `npm run check:fonts` — it reads the library from source, so a new family is
   allowed everywhere the moment it lands in `FONTS`.

Removing one is the same in reverse: drop it from `FONTS`, then run the gate,
which will point at every surface still naming it.
