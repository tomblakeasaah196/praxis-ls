# The Control Tower

How the home screen became a tool for running a Monday operations meeting rather
than a picture of one.

Companion to [VERIFIED_PLACES.md](VERIFIED_PLACES.md), which is where the
coordinates come from. Nothing here can be honest without that. The headline
metric band below the map — its catalog, its per-role configuration, and the
policy that says a zero is a truth and an unavailable tile is a counted gap —
is specified in [KPI_BAND_ENGINEERING_GUIDE.md](KPI_BAND_ENGINEERING_GUIDE.md).

## What was wrong

The tower drew **one line per file**, from POL to POD.

That is the main carriage and nothing else. So an end-to-end file — collect from
the shipper's yard, export customs, sail, import customs, truck inland, deliver
to the door — showed **one of its five movements**, and the four an operator is
actually chased about were invisible. Three further consequences followed from the
same root:

1. **Files that move nothing had nowhere to go.** Warehousing, Customs Brokerage
   and Business Representation are real files with real deadlines and no route.
   The tower either dropped them off the screen or drew a lane between two places
   one of them happened to mention.
2. **A file with an unverified location was drawn anyway.** The coordinate was
   either absent or a background geocode nobody had confirmed — and the map made
   no distinction, so a guess and a fact rendered identically.
3. **Nothing could be selected.** No hover detail, no keyboard route, no way to
   ask "what is happening with this one?" without navigating away and losing the
   map, the other eleven files, and the thread of the conversation.

## A lane is now one itinerary leg

`toLanes` produces **one drawn segment per plottable leg**, with the file's
`dossier_id` tying them together for selection. A file with no structured
itinerary falls back to a single synthetic main carriage from its POL/POD — that
is not legacy cruft, it is exactly what such a file is.

`plottable` is the server's verdict and the rule that stops the map lying: **both**
ends must resolve to a coordinate. One end is not a leg, and a line drawn from a
real port to an assumed point is the fabricated route the old hand-drawn map drew.

## Mode comes from the itinerary, not from the service-type name

`MODE_EXPR` in `dashboard.repo.js` reads the main carriage's own mode first and
falls back to the key heuristic.

That order fixes a real misclassification. The key patterns had to put
`PROJECT_CARGO` somewhere and chose the road corridors — so a file whose main
carriage is a chartered vessel was **filtered, coloured and counted as a truck**.
The leg knows; the key is the fallback for a file with no structured legs yet.

`OTHER` is a real answer, not a failure. Warehousing, brokerage and representation
have no transport mode, and forcing one on them is how a storage file ends up
drawn as a shipping lane.

## Three layers, and the counts add up

| Layer            | What is in it                             | Where                              |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Movement         | Files with endpoints or a transport leg   | The map                            |
| Activity         | Files that record work at a place         | "Not on the map"                   |
| Needs a location | Files naming a place that is not verified | "Not on the map", exceptions first |

All three are computed **server-side over the whole filtered set**, not from the
visible page. A count derived from 50 rows would say "2 files need a location" on
page one of eleven, which is worse than saying nothing. The count query carries
every predicate the page query does — `TOWER_FROM` is shared so a filter added to
one cannot be missing from the other, which is the class of bug that makes a
header say 12 above a list of 3.

## Interaction

- **Click or Enter** a route, a list row or an activity row → selects that file:
  the map zooms to it, the other routes de-emphasise, the itinerary opens beside
  it. Clicking it again clears the selection; so does Escape.
- **Hover or focus** a route → a card with the file, the leg, the route, the
  milestone, the date and the progress.
- **Arrow keys** step between files. The routes are **one composite widget** with
  one tab stop, not one stop per lane: a hundred-file map has ~300 legs, and one
  stop each would make the keyboard a worse way to move than the mouse — which is
  how keyboard support ends up unused and then removed.
- **Hover is never the only route to information** (WCAG §1.4.13). The card
  renders on focus, and everything in it is in the panel a click opens.

## Colour and shape

Four modes, four fixed hues, from four declared tokens:

| Mode | Colour | Token         |
| ---- | ------ | ------------- |
| Sea  | Green  | `--mode-sea`  |
| Air  | Blue   | `--mode-air`  |
| Road | Orange | `--mode-road` |
| Rail | Purple | `--mode-rail` |

They are their own tokens rather than borrowed ones, and that is a fix. Sea was
`--brand-blue-bright` and air was `--brand-blue` — the same hue two steps apart,
which on a 2px dashed line at this zoom is not a distinction: on the deployed map a
vessel leg and a flight leg drew as one colour. Road was `--primary`, so the third
was a function of the _tenant's_ brand, and a tenant with a blue brand would have
lost road onto air as well while the legend went on naming three colours the map
drew as two. A mode is not decoration and it is not brand — it is what the cargo is
on.

**Two glyph vocabularies, because there are two questions.**

| Marker                          | Shows                    | Vocabulary                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The one **travelling** the lane | What the cargo is _on_   | Ship / plane / truck / train, by mode, turned along the path so it also shows direction                         |
| The **fixed endpoint**          | What kind of place it is | Ship for a seaport, plane for an airport, rooftops for a city, warehouse for a terminal, gate for a border post |

A port is a port whichever leg touches it, and a port that ends a sea leg and starts
a road leg cannot be given one mode without picking a side — its _kind_ is
unambiguous. So a road leg's endpoints are cities and addresses rather than trucks,
which is right: the truck is the thing moving between them.

Before this the map drew one anonymous circle for every place, so a twelve-file map
was twelve identical dots and the only way to tell a port from a customer's door was
to read the label.

## Honesty on the map

Shape and fill are two separate axes on the same marker. Shape says what kind of
place; **fill says whether the coordinate is trusted**, and adding shape did not
cost that:

| Drawn as                    | Means                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Solid glyph                 | A verified place at a confirmed coordinate                                                                                                                                            |
| **Hollow** glyph            | A **reference point** — verified, and explicitly not the exact address                                                                                                                |
| Larger **circle** with `+n` | A cluster. It keeps the circle deliberately: it stands for several places of possibly different kinds, and stamping the first one's shape on the group would claim they are all ports |
| Not drawn at all            | No verified coordinate. It is in the exception list instead                                                                                                                           |

Clustering is **off below 24 endpoints**. Collapsing four ports at the mouth of one
river loses information, and on a five-file map there is room to draw all four.
Past two dozen there is not — they become a smear with no readable name in it,
which is the state a hundred-file tower is in and the one a meeting is most likely
to hit. The surviving marker keeps the **first** node's position rather than the
centroid, because an averaged pin sits in the sea between two ports and points at
neither.

## Full screen and meeting mode

Both are fixed overlays with `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal` and Escape — **not** the
Fullscreen API, which takes the whole display and is unavailable on non-video
elements in iOS Safari and inside an iframe-embedded deployment.

### They are portalled, and that was a bug fix

Both were `fixed inset-0 z-50`, rendered in place. `z-50` beats the ribbon's `z-30`
and the title bar's `z-40` on paper — and on screen the ribbon painted straight over
the top of them, clipping the heading and the exit button behind the nav tabs.

`z-index` only orders siblings **within a stacking context**. The overlays were
rendered deep inside the scrolling content region, whose own ancestor establishes a
context, so `z-50` competed with the map card's siblings rather than with the app
chrome. No z-index on the overlay could ever have escaped it. `ScreenOverlay`
portals to `document.body`, where the z-index means what it says.

### They start below the title bar, by geometry

`top: var(--titlebar-h)`, not `inset-0`. The title bar carries the window controls
and _is_ the draggable region in the desktop build — an overlay across it leaves no
way to move or close the window. `--titlebar-h` is the composed height
(density-linked, widened by `env(titlebar-area-height)` under Window Controls
Overlay), so this survives a density change and macOS's taller strip.

Geometry rather than z-order because an overlay that merely sits _behind_ the title
bar still paints its own background under it and the two surfaces fight. Starting
below it leaves nothing to resolve.

### And they fit

`min-h-0` on every flex ancestor, and the map's `<svg>` switches from `h-auto`
(derive height from width — correct in the dashboard card, which has no box to fit)
to `h-full` with `preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet"`. A flex item defaults to
`min-height: auto` and refuses to shrink below its content, which is exactly how a
fixed-aspect map computed a height from the full viewport width and ran off the
bottom of the screen with the southern hemisphere cut off.

Nothing scrolls in either overlay. In the meeting view the header, the stat tiles
and the legend are `flex-none` and only the map grows, so a short viewport takes
height out of the map rather than out of the numbers the room is reading — a
projected view that has to be scrolled to be complete is one whose bottom half
nobody sees. The page behind is locked while an overlay is up and released when it
closes.

Meeting mode is a **mode, not a route**: a separate screen would be a second
surface to keep in step, and it would drift. It wraps the same components with a
different emphasis, so every filter and the current selection carry straight into
it. It is read-only by construction — the person driving a projector is talking,
not watching their cursor, and an "archive" one click from the mouse position is a
hazard.

Auto-refresh is **off until asked for** and pausable, with the last refresh time on
screen. A map that silently re-fits mid-sentence because a file changed in another
tab is worse than a stale one: the room loses its place. A number that is honestly
stale beats one that is silently moving.

## The itinerary editor

`dossier_itinerary_leg` gained execution columns in `0677`: `actual_departure`,
`actual_arrival`, `milestone_instance_id`, and `source` (`TEMPLATE` vs `MANUAL`).

The editor was 37 lines — a leg type, a mode, and two free-text boxes. So the one
screen whose job is to record where cargo goes could not record a verified place, a
date, a carrier, or **the order the legs happen in**. It now does all four, plus
reordering, optional legs, unsaved-change tracking and revert.

Two rules are enforced on the server, in `itinerary.service`:

- **Places must already be in the catalogue.** Saving used to call
  `geoPlace.resolveMany`, which reaches Geoapify on a miss — so an itinerary could
  silently invent a coordinate for a mistyped place, the exact failure the
  dossier's own save path was fixed to stop. The lookup is now local, and errors
  are keyed by leg index so the editor marks the offending row.
- **The service type's structural legs must survive an edit.** A Sea Import with
  its main carriage deleted is not an edited Sea Import; it is a file whose service
  type no longer describes it while everything downstream still assumes it does.
  Legs the template did not mark optional are required, and the refusal names them.

### `replace` is transactional now

It was a `DELETE` followed by `INSERT`s on a pooled client with no transaction. A
leg that violated a CHECK constraint on insert left the dossier with **no itinerary
at all** — the whole route silently gone, while the operator looked at a save error
that said nothing about it. It now either replaces or changes nothing.

`seq` is assigned from **array position** and the caller's own value is ignored.
Ordering is what the array means; honouring a client's numbering is how you get two
legs numbered 3 and a `UNIQUE (dossier_id, seq)` violation reported as a database
error.

## The itinerary is derived, not asked for twice

A file's geography is four fields — collection, POL, POD, delivery — and
`legsFromTemplate` walks the service type's template at promotion, filling each leg
from them. A door-to-door sea file opens with all four of its legs already drawn:

```
PICKUP:         Antwerp  → Shanghai     (from place_receipt → pol)
MAIN_CARRIAGE:  Shanghai → Douala       (pol → pod)
CUSTOMS:        Douala                  (pinned; a clearance is not a movement)
FINAL_DELIVERY: Douala   → Yaoundé      (pod → place_delivery)
```

### What this replaced

The wizard used to carry its own "collect from the shipper" and "deliver to the
consignee" pickers, which **appended** PICKUP and FINAL_DELIVERY legs after
promotion. Every freight template has declared both legs since 0673 — so the
toggles produced a _second_ one each. Two delivery legs, two identical lines
between the same two places, and the delivery address stored twice with nothing
keeping the copies in step, while the `place_delivery` field sat on the very same
form asking the same question.

The wizard now asks nothing extra, and creating a file is one call.

### The two rules that keep the walk honest

- **Both ends or neither.** `assertLegsResolvable` refuses a movement leg with one
  end, and rightly: half a leg cannot be drawn or planned against. A sea import
  whose consignee collects at the quay is a normal file, and its optional delivery
  leg is simply empty rather than a dangling origin.
- **A leg that moves nothing gets no places.** Checked against where the cargo
  _is_, not against the leg's own two ends — a hinterland file's inland transit
  already reaches the final destination, so filling its optional delivery leg from
  the same pair would put a second identical line on the map.

Activity legs pin to the cargo's position and carry no destination. Inventing a
second end so a clearance matches the shape of a movement is how customs ends up
drawn as a journey.

Migration `0678` is what makes the walk possible: air and project files had a
delivery leg in their template and no field to fill it from, the two end-to-end
types had a required pickup leg and no collection field, and the sea profile's
delivery field had no facet role — so it was still a free-text box. See
[VERIFIED_PLACES.md](VERIFIED_PLACES.md#where-0676-missed-and-what-0678-does-about-it).

## Dates are day-first

Every date on an operations screen and on the tower's filters is `dd/mm/yyyy`,
through the repo's `DateField`.

A native `<input type="date">` renders in the **operating system's** locale, and no
HTML attribute overrides it — `lang` is ignored for the value display. So the same
ETA read as the 3rd of July on one operator's machine and the 7th of March on the
next, with nothing on screen to say which. For a day-first audience that is a
papercut on every file, and on a leg's actual-arrival date it is a wrong number in
a meeting. `DateField` shows and accepts day-first, masks the slashes as you type,
keeps the platform calendar one click away, and still stores the ISO date the API
wants — so nothing downstream changed.

## Deep links

The itinerary panel links to `/operations/files?ref=<ref>&focus=<dossier_id>`.

`ref` seeds the hub's search so the row is on the page; `focus` is the hub's
existing convention (`useFocusRow`) for scrolling to a row and opening its 360. The
previous tower could only send `ref` — a display string — so the link landed on a
filtered **list** and the operator had to click the row they had already chosen on
the map.
