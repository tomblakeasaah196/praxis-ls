# Praxis LS — Phase → Module Map (complete, nothing left out)

Every MOD-xx from the platform catalogue, mapped to the phase(s) it belongs to.
Modules that legitimately span phases are **listed in each** (marked ↔). Status:
✅ built real · 🟡 partial/real-but-thin · ⬜ generic CRUD stub · 🧩 schema only.
(Derived from `WORK_TO_BE_DONE.md` phases + the KB + the MOD catalogue. Group in
parentheses.) Last refresh: after Phase-1/2 gap-closure sprint (see
`PHASE1_2_REAUDIT.md`).

---

## Cross-phase modules (listed in >1 phase above)

- MOD-02 Employees — P2, P3
- MOD-27 Margin Simulator / Pricing Variance — P2, P4

## Phase-1 & Phase-2 status — all module gaps CLOSED
Every module belonging to Phase 1 and Phase 2 is now a real module (custom
service + repo + pure rules + gated routes + validator), not a generic CRUD
stub. The gap-closure sprint upgraded: MOD-06, MOD-09, MOD-01, MOD-10, MOD-27,
MOD-28, MOD-30, MOD-32, MOD-49, MOD-52, MOD-53, MOD-56 (grand livre), MOD-59
(TAFIRE), MOD-60/61/62, MOD-66 (scan) and added the dossier 360° view.

Remaining non-blocking items that touch P1/P2 surfaces (tracked to later phases):
- PDF/Email runtime (Chromium + SMTP) — code complete, infra provisioning is P5.
- MOD-54 Asset Management — schema present, module is Phase 3.
- MOD-27 Pricing Variance Index (Sales R/Y/G) — the *simulator* is done (P2);
  the sales-facing variance index is Phase 4.
- Sales cycle MOD-20..26 — Phase 4.
