## Problems Addressed

| # | User Report | Root Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | "It snooze a lot — proposes an action and doesn't execute until another prompt" | System prompt said "wait for go-ahead before proposing next" + confirm narration asked "shall I proceed?" | Removed wait-for-go-ahead; auto-propose next step after confirm |
| 2 | "Confuses itself when details are provided — keeps saying missing fields" | `validatePayload` rejected unknown keys (e.g. `client_name` vs `client_id`) | Lenient validation: only required fields enforced, unknown fields pass through |
| 3 | "Drafts well but can't execute what it drafted" | No guidance on draft→execute flow; system stopped after drafting to ask permission | System prompt now says "draft AND immediately call the write function" |
| 4 | "Should cover actions from anywhere in the system" | Only 3 entity card builders; tool scoping dropped domain abbreviations | Expanded to 12 entity types; added domain synonym dictionary |
| 5 | "Must not speak raw/database language" | Prompt rule was present but not strong enough | Strengthened with absolute language rules + self-correction guidance |
| 6 | "Should self-learn from patterns" | No execution history feedback to the model | Recent successful action patterns injected into system prompt |
| 7 | "Render response word-by-word while generating" | Full completion awaited before rendering | SSE streaming endpoint + client-side incremental rendering |

## Files Changed

### Server (Node.js)

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `src/services/ai/llm.service.js` | Added `chatStream()` and `callVendorStream()` for SSE-based token streaming from DeepSeek/Gemini. Falls back to non-streaming `callVendor` when streaming fails. |
| `src/services/ai/orchestrator.service.js` | **7 fixes in one file:** (1) `askStream()` generator yielding SSE events; (2) system prompt: auto-continue after confirm; (3) system prompt: draft→execute in one flow; (4) lenient `validatePayload` (required-only); (5) domain synonym dictionary for tool scoping; (6) `recentPatterns()` for self-learning; (7) strengthened language rules. Also: `confirmAction` narration now auto-proposes next step via follow-up `ask()` call. |
| `src/modules/ai/assistant/assistant.service.js` | Added `askStream` export wrapping `orchestrator.askStream`. |
| `src/modules/ai/assistant/assistant.controller.js` | Added `askStream` SSE controller: sets `text/event-stream` headers, 15s heartbeat, client disconnect detection, pipes generator events as `data: {json}\n\n`. |
| `src/modules/ai/assistant/assistant.routes.js` | Mounted `POST /ai/ask/stream` route. |
| `src/services/ai/knowledge/entity-cards.js` | Expanded from 3 to 12 entity card builders: added `final_invoice`, `quotation`, `supplier_master`, `purchase_order`, `employee`, `vehicle`, `proforma`, `supplier_invoice`, `lead`, `opportunity`. |

### Client (TypeScript/React)

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `client/src/lib/ai-api.ts` | Added `AiStreamEvent` type union, `askPraxisStream()` async generator consuming SSE via fetch ReadableStream. Auto-fallback to non-streaming `askPraxis` on 404/network error. Updated `confirmAiAction` return type to include `next_actions`. |
| `client/src/components/ai/thread.ts` | Rewrote `send()` to consume `askPraxisStream`: creates assistant turn immediately with empty text, updates in place as deltas arrive. Added `streamAbort` ref for cancellation. Updated `confirmAction` to render `next_actions` from confirm response. Updated `newThread` to abort in-flight streams. |
| `client/src/features/ai/workspace.tsx` | Thinking indicator hides once streaming text starts arriving (the growing answer IS the thinking). |

### Tests

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `tests/unit/ai-streaming.test.js` | Tests for lenient validation, SSE event parsing, and pattern block generation. |

## Architecture: Auto-Continue After Confirm

```
Before (snooze loop):
  User: "Create a dossier for SODECOTON"
  AI: [proposes open_dossier action card]
  User: [clicks Confirm]
  AI: "✓ Created dossier SBX-2026-0042. Shall I create a costing for it?"
  User: "Yes"                          ← wasted turn
  AI: [proposes create_costing]
  User: [clicks Confirm]
  AI: "✓ Created costing. Shall I…?"
  User: "Yes"                          ← wasted turn
  …

After (auto-continue):
  User: "Create a dossier for SODECOTON"
  AI: [proposes open_dossier action card]
  User: [clicks Confirm]
  AI: "✓ Created dossier SBX-2026-0042.
       [proposes create_costing action card]"    ← auto-proposed
  User: [clicks Confirm]
  AI: "✓ Created costing CST-2026-0018.
       [proposes draft_quotation action card]"   ← auto-proposed
  …
```

## Key Design Decisions

### Why SSE and not WebSockets?
The existing realtime layer uses Socket.IO for push notifications, but streaming an answer is request-response. SSE is simpler (no upgrade, no bidirectional), works over HTTP/2, auto-reconnects in browsers, and doesn't couple chat to the notification socket.

### Why `fetch` and not `EventSource`?
`EventSource` is GET-only and cannot carry the POST body or auth headers. `fetch` with `ReadableStream` gives us POST + headers + abort control.

### Why non-streaming for read-tool narration?
Read tools execute database queries and the narration LLM call needs the full tool output before generating text. Streaming would add latency without visible benefit — the user sees nothing until the narration is complete anyway. Only the INITIAL model call streams, because that's the one the user stares at while waiting.

### Why lenient validation instead of field mapping?
Field mapping (e.g. `client_name` → look up → `client_id`) was considered but rejected because: (1) the interactive form already handles this via `field_meta` dropdowns; (2) the model's pre-filled values are a starting point the user can edit; (3) strict validation caused the "confuses itself" problem. Lenient validation lets the proposed action reach the form, where the user can correct anything before confirming.

### Why auto-propose from `confirmAction` and not from the client?
The server has the full conversation context and the executor registry. A client-side auto-ask would need to synthesize a message and re-enter the `send()` flow, duplicating logic. The server's `confirmAction` already has everything it needs to propose the next step in one round-trip.
