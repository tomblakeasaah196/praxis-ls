# chromium + shared libs/fonts: PDF rendering (invoices, reports, payslips) goes
# through src/services/pdf.service.js (Puppeteer) from both the API process
# (runtime) and the BullMQ worker (report-processor.js), so both stages need a
# working headless Chromium. Alpine's puppeteer-bundled Chromium download is
# glibc-only and fails to launch on musl, so we install the distro package
# instead and point Puppeteer at it (PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH below) while
# skipping its own download during `npm ci`. ttf-freefont gives PDF output
# (e.g. the ₦ Naira sign in pdf.templates.js) broad glyph coverage.

# Alpine's chromium package installs the binary at /usr/bin/chromium (the legacy
# /usr/bin/chromium-browser name no longer exists on current Alpine). pdf.service
# also auto-detects the real path, so a mismatch here no longer breaks rendering.
