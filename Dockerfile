# chromium + shared libs/fonts: PDF rendering (invoices, reports, payslips) goes
# through src/services/pdf.service.js (Puppeteer) from both the API process
# (runtime) and the BullMQ worker (report-processor.js), so both stages need a
# working headless Chromium. Alpine's puppeteer-bundled Chromium download is
# glibc-only and fails to launch on musl, so we install the distro package
# instead and point Puppeteer at it (PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH below) while
# skipping its own download during `npm ci`. ttf-freefont gives PDF output
# (e.g. the ₦ Naira sign in pdf.templates.js) broad glyph coverage.
# postgresql16-client is PINNED TO THE SERVER MAJOR (docker-compose runs
# pgvector/pgvector:pg16), not left as the floating `postgresql-client`.
#
# WS-B1 runs pg_dump from the worker container, and pg_dump REFUSES to dump a
# server newer than itself — "server version 16.2; pg_dump version 15.6" and it
# aborts. Unpinned, the client version rides whatever Alpine the current
# node:20-alpine happens to be built on, so a base-image rebuild months from now
# could move it under a server that has not changed. The failure would land at
# 01:00 in a container nobody watches, and the symptom is silence: no dump, no
# alert unless one is configured. Pinning makes the dependency explicit and
# turns a future mismatch into a BUILD failure instead of a backup one.
#
# When the server major moves, this pin moves with it — and `npm run
# db:backup:preflight` checks the pair at runtime either way.

# present, npm cannot link it.
#
# 2026-08-04: this was missing, and the failure mode was quiet. The layer was
# cached from before @praxis/shared was added, so builds kept succeeding while
# producing an image whose node_modules had no @praxis/shared. The only importer
# is finance/final_invoice/final_invoice.validator.js, so `require()` of that
# module threw and the module-loader skipped it — meaning the INVOICING MODULE
# was absent from the running API and every one of its routes 404'd,
# indistinguishable from a wrong URL (audit API F-19).
#
# It was also a time bomb: the next change to package.json invalidates the cache,
# npm install hits the missing path, and the build fails outright.

# Both stages ran as root, and compose bind-mounts ./data (the document vault),
# ./media, ./uploads and ./logs into them. A single RCE-class bug in a
# root-owned process therefore reached the host filesystem with full rights over
# every file it could see, and the vault holds contracts, payslips and ID
# documents. Dropping to an unprivileged user does not fix such a bug; it caps

#
# THE BIND MOUNTS ARE THE OPERATIONAL HALF, and this is the part that breaks a
# deployment if it is skipped: a host directory owned by root stays root-owned
# inside the container, so the app would start and then fail its first write —
# a rendered PDF, a log line — at runtime rather than at boot. scripts/deploy.sh
# now chowns those four paths to 1000:1000 before bringing containers up. An
# existing deployment's files are root-owned today, so that first run does the
# one-off repair.
