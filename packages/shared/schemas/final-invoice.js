/**
 * Final invoice payloads.
 *
 * Lifted VERBATIM in meaning from `src/modules/finance/final_invoice/
 * final_invoice.validator.js`, which is now the consumer rather than the owner.
 * This is the first domain moved because it is the one the audit names: F12
 * cites `features/finance/pages.tsx:141`'s `canSubmit` boolean as the client's
 * parallel, un-shared re-statement of these same rules.
 *
 * The only changes from the original are messages. The API's schema produced
 * Zod's defaults ("Invalid uuid"), which was acceptable when they were only
 * ever flattened into one banner. Now that the client renders them per FIELD
 * (see the Field `error` prop), they are read by an operator and need to say
 * something an operator can act on.

/**
 * AN INVOICE LINE IS qty × unit_price, NOT A LUMP (§2.2).
 *
 * This schema used to accept a single `amount`, and the service turned that
 * into `qty: 1, unit_price: amount`. So a caller holding "40 containers at
 * 2,000,000" had nowhere to put the 40: it pre-multiplied to 80,000,000 and the
 * invoice printed one unit at eighty million. That is invoice fb7db2f3 exactly
 * — three lines, every qty 1, every unit price an extended COST, and no VAT.
 *
 * `qty` and `unit_price` are the real shape (invoice_line has carried both
 * since 0230:85), and the extension is computed server-side rather than
 * trusted from the caller.
 *
 * `amount` is retained as a deprecated alias so existing callers and the AI
 * tool surface keep working; it means "one unit at this price" and nothing
 * else. Exactly one of the two forms must be present.
 *
 * `tax_code_id` was simply absent — the column exists (0230:88) and nothing
 * ever wrote it, which is the other half of why the invoice showed TVA 0.00.
