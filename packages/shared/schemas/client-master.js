/**
 * Client master payloads.
 *
 * The consumer of this schema is `src/modules/master/client_master/
 * client_master.validator.js` (an adapter, not the owner) and — for PR 2 — the
 * client's create/edit form. One definition, both sides.
 *
 * SHAPE ONLY. This is a pure shape schema (types + `""`→undefined
 * normalisation); it does NOT decide which fields are mandatory. That is
 * per-tenant policy and lives in `party_field_config`, applied on top of this by
 * `party-config.js` at the API boundary (spec §5.2). The only field this schema
 * hard-requires is `name`, because a nameless client is not a client on any
 * tenant.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT HERE, deliberately. `verification_status`, `compliance_state`,
 * `avl_status`, `coa_aux_account`, `hard_block*`, `screened_*` are owned by the
 * service and its gated endpoints — a client must not be able to PATCH itself to
 * VERIFIED and walk past the digital-scan gate (Hard Rule 9). `registration_status`
 * IS accepted on update because moving to ACTIVE is what triggers aux-account
 * allocation, and that transition is what the service guards.
 *
 * The blank-normalisation helpers now live in `common.js` so this schema and the
 * supplier one share them; see the note there on the `optional().or("")` pattern
 * this replaced.
