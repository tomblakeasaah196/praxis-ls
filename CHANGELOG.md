# Changelog

All notable changes to Praxis LS.

**Why this file exists (TC-R1).** There was no unit of "a release" in this
system — no tags, no GitHub releases, no changelog, and all three
`package.json` files frozen at `0.1.0` across 93 CI runs and 44 production
deploys. Every commit was silently a deployment, and the only way to answer
"what changed between Tuesday and Thursday?" was to read `git log` and hope the
messages were useful. They often were not: the merge commits — the ones a
changelog would be built from — include _"Lots of changes"_, _"a lot"_ and
_"audit portan and opportunities board list"_ (TC-R4).

**How to use it.** Add a line under `## Unreleased` in the same PR as the
change. At release time, rename that heading to the version and date, tag the
commit (`git tag -a v0.2.0 -m "..."`), and start a fresh `Unreleased`.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Dates are ISO-8601, UTC.

## Unreleased

### Added

- **The stranger-facing app (`public-web/`), behind `SERVE_PUBLIC_WEB`.** A third Vite app beside
  `client/` and `platform-console/`, carrying the tenant marketing site (`/public/*`) and the
  external portal (`/portal/*`) on the tenant's own origin — a client emailed a tracking link must
  not be sent to a second domain whose cookies, CSP and Host resolution the ERP knows nothing about.
  Bilingual, gated in CI by `check:i18n` (457 keys, both languages) and `check:bundle` (110.8 kB gzip
  first paint against a 128 kB budget, acyclic chunk graph). `SERVE_PUBLIC_WEB` is **off by default**:
  the mount also claims `/track`, `/portfolio`, `/careers` and `/client-portal`, which the ERP
  already answers, so the switch is a deliberate act rather than a side effect of building the image.
  Turning it off restores the ERP's own versions of those pages; no schema or data is involved.

### Fixed

- **The marketing prefix is a per-host setting.** `/public` was typed into ninety-odd places, which made
  it a decision the whole fleet shared and nobody could revisit — and it is one a tenant has an opinion
  about, since the word is in every URL they print, email or hand to a search engine. Migration `0104` adds
  `public_base` to `platform.subdomain`; the server builds its path matcher per request from the resolved
  value, and `src/shared/http/public-web-paths.js` is the single definition the mount, the console
  validation and the test all read. The browser learns it from a `<meta>` tag the head injector already
  rewrites per request — no build-time constant, so one image serves every prefix. `/portal` deliberately
  does not move: invitation emails point at it with a seven-day expiry. `/public` stays claimed whatever
  the base is and redirects to it, so renaming cannot strand a URL already in circulation. Prefixes the
  workspace answers — every ERP section, `/login`, `/api`, `/portal` — are refused with a reason.
- **A domain the client brings serves the site at its ROOT, not under the prefix.** The prefix exists to
  keep the marketing site out of the workspace's way on a shared origin; on `smartls.cm`, where
  `surface = 'public'` and the ERP is not served at all, there is nothing to stay out of the way of. The
  first cut honoured `public_base` there anyway, so the client's homepage was `smartls.cm/public` with `/`
  redirecting into it, and every URL they printed carried a word that means nothing to their customers.
  The surface now decides the base and the column applies to workspace hosts, which took three latent
  self-redirects with it: `/` → `/`, each legacy alias → itself, and `LegacySplat` joining `"/"` with a
  tail to make `//track` — a protocol-relative URL a browser reads as the host `track`. Two things that
  were already wrong on a RENAMED prefix are fixed by the same change: the head injector's route table
  matched a literal `/public/…`, so a `/site` tenant silently lost every link preview, and `robots.txt`
  disallowed `/public/proposals/` on hosts that serve proposals somewhere else — a rule that reads as
  covered and protects nothing. `public-web/src/app/root-mount.test.tsx` pins all of it.
- **A CV over about 1.4 MB was refused after the applicant had waited for the upload.** The form
  advertises 8 MB and `careers.service.CV_MAX_BYTES` enforces 8 MB, but the file is base64-encoded into a
  JSON body — a third larger on the wire — against a 2 MB global limit, so most phone-scanned CVs were
  impossible to send and the promise had never been keepable. A 12 MB parser now covers that one public
  path, mounted BEFORE the global one because body-parser sets `req._body` and every later parser bails on
  it. No other route's limit changes.
- **The tenant's marketing hero had no home of its own.** It rendered whatever had been uploaded as the
  LOGIN background — one file doing two unrelated jobs, configured in Settings → Login, which is not where
  anyone looks for the photograph on their public website. `POST /branding/site/hero` now stores it under
  its own `site/` segment (added to the public media allow-list) with a 1 MB cap, and the hero prefers it
  while still falling back to the login background so no existing tenant's hero goes blank on deploy.
  Service-type covers already had an upload; only this one was missing.
- **The portal sign-in read "Client portal CLIENT PORTAL".** With no tenant name and no logo the wordmark
  falls back to the portal's own noun, and the eyebrow beside it repeated the same two words — which is
  what every unconfigured workspace showed its clients. The eyebrow now renders only when the wordmark is
  the tenant. The screen also states what the account is for and offers the two ways out it lacked: the
  invitation route for someone with a link but no password, and tracking for someone with no account at
  all. It is one of the two screens a paying client opens every week and was a bare pair of inputs on white.
- **Twenty-two user-facing sentences were English on the French site**, and the gate said both languages
  were complete. `check-i18n` rule 5 reads text between JSX tags in `.tsx` files, so a sentence that is a
  STRING — a `.ts` module's error message, a `hint=` prop, an argument to `tr()` — was structurally
  invisible to it: the quote form's failure message, every portal session-expiry and download error, the
  CV size limit, six portal empty states. All now carry dotted keys. Rule 6 fails the build on any
  sentence outside the dictionary anywhere in `src/` — punctuation is the signal, and run against the app
  before it was wired in it found twenty-two real strings and no false ones.
- **`tr()` could never translate a sentence.** It looks a label up as `strings.<label>` and i18next's
  default `keySeparator` is `.`, which this app does not disable because every other key is dotted. So a
  label containing a full stop is parsed as a path with an empty final segment, never resolves, and
  silently returns English. That is why all 41 `strings` entries are period-free column headings. Now
  documented on the function, and enforced by rule 6.
- **Marketing images were served as if they were a JSON list.** Case-study and service covers stream from
  the Node process with `Cache-Control: max-age=300`, so every visitor re-fetched every image twice an
  hour, and they counted against the same 120/15min budget as the page's data — meaning the page with the
  most images was the one most likely to have them refused. The id in the URL is the vault document's, so
  the bytes behind a URL never change: now a year, `immutable`, with an ETag, and images have their own
  budget.
- **Forwarded links previewed as a blank grey card.** The pages are assembled in the browser, so Slack,
  WhatsApp, LinkedIn and Bing received the shell — one generic title, no description. `shared/http/public-head.js`
  now injects a real title, description, canonical and Open Graph tags per page, reading the record for
  proposals, vacancies and case notes; and the host serves `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml`, with a
  workspace host asking not to be indexed and tokenised documents kept out of the index. It is the head,
  not the body — not SSR, and it does not pretend to be — but a preview card and a search result are built
  from the head. Any failure serves the untouched shell.
- **`public-web` served a blank page in production.** Vite's default `assetsDir` put the app's own
  bundle at `/assets/*`, which `PUBLIC_WEB_PATH` did not claim — so every chunk, stylesheet and font
  fell through to `client/dist` (a miss: different hashes) and then to the ERP's `app.get("*")`,
  which answered `index.html` with `200 text/html`. The browser refuses to execute HTML as a module,
  so the shell loaded and the app never started. Neither `vite dev` nor `vite preview` goes through
  that mount, which is why it was invisible in development. The app now builds into `public-assets/`
  and the mount claims it; `tests/unit/public-web-mount.test.js` reads the directory name out of
  `vite.config.ts` and the matcher out of `server.js` and pins the two together, which is the test
  the comment above the mount had been claiming existed.
- **The ERP's service worker shadowed the new pages with its own older copies of them.**
  `navigateFallbackDenylist` listed only `/api`, `/media`, the manifest and the icons, so for anyone
  who had ever loaded the ERP the cached shell answered `/public/*` and `/portal/*` before the
  request reached the server — and because `client/` still routes those paths itself, the visitor
  saw not an error but a plausible older implementation at the same URL.
- **Raw server messages reached public pages.** `lib/api.ts` exported `messageFor()` to keep driver
  errors and status text away from strangers, and nothing called it: a job applicant hitting a 500
  read "Internal Server Error". All seven read handlers now route through it with a translated
  fallback (`common.loadFailed`), read via a new module-level `tStatic` so `t` does not become an
  effect dependency and a language switch does not re-run a rate-limited tracking lookup.
- **The home page discarded the service covers the API returns.** `ServicesBand` built its cards
  without `cover_url` while the band eleven lines below passed the same field to the same component,
  so the home page showed four text boxes for services that `/public/services` renders as image cards.
- **The hero's scrim hid the tenant's artwork.** A flat carbon 95%→72% wash kept copy safe and made
  any photograph invisible. Measured against the worst case a tenant can upload, the binding
  constraint is the orange eyebrow at α ≥ 0.87 (not the headline, at 0.48), so the scrim now holds
  ≥ 0.90 wherever copy sits and falls away where it does not — radially at `lg`, downward below it.
- **A brand-token flash on dark-OS first paint.** The pre-paint script wrote only `.dark` and never
  `data-theme`, so `@praxis/brand/tokens.css` followed `prefers-color-scheme` and painted dark brand
  values under light app tokens until `main.tsx` ran — the exact mismatch `theme-mode.ts` says the
  attribute exists to prevent.
- **Disabled buttons read as broken.** `disabled:opacity-55` over a brand fill produced a washed-out
  orange on the first two controls a visitor meets. Disabled now uses neutral tokens; a submitting
  button keeps its fill via `aria-busy`.
- **The footer listed "Client portal" twice** (two keys rendering the same words at two paths) and
  "Track a shipment" in two columns. `check:i18n` cannot catch that: both keys exist in both
  languages, and it looks for missing text rather than for two keys that agree.
- **`check:bundle` hardcoded `dist/assets`** and would have reported "not found" on a correct build
  the moment the output directory was renamed. It reads `assetsDir` from the config now.

- **Weekly lateness queries and the authorised attendance map (clock-in revamp PR 3 — the last of
  the three).** After a week closes, an employee who was late on one or more EXPECTED WORKING
  DAYS is asked once about the pattern rather than five times about five mornings: `attendance.weekly`
  composes and upserts exactly one `WARNING` query per person per completed Mon–Sun week, employee
  only (managers and HR have analytics; a batch job must not raise a disciplinary document against
  somebody on their behalf). Expected days come from PR1's calendar resolver, never from the
  reconciled status, so a Mon–Sat yard and a Mon–Fri office are counted differently; waived days are
  excluded from the count and stated rather than dropped. Migration `12746` adds `WEEKLY` to
  `hr_query.source` and a dedicated partial unique index `(employee_id, work_date) WHERE source =
  'WEEKLY'` — the weekly row carries `hr_rule_id = NULL` so it stays OUT of 0704's daily index (where
  a week-end date would collide with that day's own lateness query), and because a NULL is distinct
  from every other NULL in a unique index, that dedicated index is the entire deduplication story.
  The nightly reconcile job gained the step, gated on Monday in the workplace zone, running on its
  OWN tenant connection AFTER the reconcile has committed: sharing one would have let a failed
  weekly INSERT abort the transaction and silently roll back every row the reconciler wrote.
  `POST /attendance/weekly-summaries` (`edit`) is the idempotent backfill and sandbox rehearsal.
- **`GET /attendance/map`** returns pinnable punches plus worksite geofences, with the guide's
  five-row permission matrix resolved in the CONTROLLER rather than by a single middleware — MOD-14
  view gets team pins and fences, a Control Tower grant unlocks the order-lane overlay, an employee
  with neither still gets their own pins, and an unlinked caller gets nothing. Punches with no fix
  are COUNTED, never placed: `Number(null)` is 0, so a finite check alone would have pinned every
  no-GPS punch at 0°N 0°E as a confident outlier. Preview tiles need a platform Geoapify key
  (resolved outside the tenant connection); without one the map degrades to coastline, fences, pins
  and an OSM link per pin.
- **Map tab on HR Attendance, and own pins on My HR.** The tab reuses the Control Tower's projection
  rather than restating it — `buildMapModel` gained one additive `points` option so an
  attendance-only user with no lanes still gets a fitted map — and draws order legs in the operations
  map's own per-mode colours only when the server says the caller may see them. My HR reads
  `/attendance/punches/mine`, closing the last unfinished PR2 contract item (guide §3.2): the
  endpoint is the boundary, so an HR manager on their own My HR page sees themselves, not their team.
  The devices queue (still pending-first) now shows where each device last punched from, which is the
  one fact that makes an unfamiliar auto-generated device name decidable.

### Fixed

- **The desktop layout gate no longer measures a page a service worker is racing it for.** The built
  app registers one (`registerType: "prompt"`, `clientsClaim: true`), so in every one of the gate's
  thirty browser contexts it installed, took control of the page, and precached 153 entries — 4.7 MB
  — into `workbox-precache-v2`. Probed directly: `navigator.serviceWorker.controller` is non-null by
  the time a spec measures anything. Three consequences, all of them nondeterminism a measurement
  gate cannot afford: a navigation answered from the precache via `navigateFallback` rather than by
  the preview server, at a moment that varies with machine load; requests issued by a service worker
  bypassing `page.route`, which is what the fixture's API mock is built on, so a screen can render
  with no data through no fault of the app; and 4.7 MB of precache per context, two workers, two
  cores. It surfaced as two chart-of-accounts specs failing on CI — an `<h1>` that never appeared and
  a selection bar that stayed empty — then failing their retry with "Target page, context or browser
  has been closed", while all thirty passed locally and on the previous commit of the same branch.
  `serviceWorkers: "block"` weakens no assertion: the gate measures layout numbers, the app lays out
  identically, and what goes away is a PWA cache being rebuilt thirty times in a throwaway profile.

- **The Error Centre's AI explanations are about this codebase now.** The explanation prompt was
  taken verbatim from `PROMPT_ErrorMonitor_Module.md` §7.4, which opens "specializing in
  Node.js/NestJS debugging" — the spec's assumed stack, and the one place §0's divergence table had
  not reached. So a production 422 on `POST /api/tenant/mail/send` was explained in terms of a
  `SendMailDto`, a `MailModule`, class-validator decorators and a NestJS `ValidationPipe`: fluent,
  authoritative, and about somebody else's system, with nothing on the page to tell an ops lead
  otherwise. `src/services/ai/codebase-brief.js` now states what this repo actually is — Node 20 +
  Express + CommonJS, Zod validators, `AppError` through one error handler, `src/modules/<area>/<module>/`
  with its five conventional files, the tenant/platform DB split — names the frameworks that are
  absent so the model stops reaching for them, and explains that a `ValidationError: VALIDATION_ERROR:
  <fields>` report is SYNTHETIC (its only frame is the route, and the failing values are not in it).
  It also resolves the failing route to the directory that serves it, read from the module tree at
  runtime rather than from a hand-kept map — `POST /api/tenant/mail/send` →
  `src/modules/mail/mail/ — mail.routes.js, mail.controller.js, mail.validator.js, …`, with 95% of
  the mounted surface resolving and silence, never a guess, for the rest. Every claim in the brief is
  pinned against the tree by `tests/unit/error-explain-grounding.test.js` (no `@nestjs`/class-validator/
  ORM in any manifest, the helpers and paths it names exist, each file it offers can be opened),
  because a description of the stack that nobody re-reads is the same failure with a different accent.
  And `prompt_version` — written to `platform.error_explanation` since day one and never read — is now
  part of the Redis key and the stored lookup, so improving the prompt actually reaches the signatures
  someone has already asked about instead of only the ones nobody has.

- **A copy field you can put two people in, and a send that says which address is wrong.** Cc and
  Bcc were one plain text input holding a comma-separated string, and the comma was the entire
  mechanism — nothing on screen said a second recipient was possible ("no plus button, nothing"), so
  a row typed the way anyone would type one (`ops@camrail.cm billing@camrail.cm`, or an address
  pasted with its display name) reached `POST /mail/send`, where `cc` and `bcc` accepted an array of
  already-bare addresses and nothing else. The answer was a 422 whose whole text was `Invalid body`,
  reported as `VALIDATION_ERROR: bcc, cc` — the offending address appeared in neither. Each address
  is now a CHIP, added by Enter, Tab, comma, semicolon or leaving the field, removed by its × or by
  Backspace (which puts it back in the field, because a mistyped address is corrected more often
  than retyped); the server parses the row the same way the composer does — separators outside `"…"`
  and `<…>`, a space between two addresses, `Jean Dupont <jean@acme.cm>` reduced to what SMTP needs,
  a cleared row read as "copy nobody", the same person twice read as once — and what is still
  refused is refused BY NAME, in the composer before the send and in `error.message` after it:
  `Cc: "jean dupont" is not an email address`. The mail module's other 28 schemas gained the same named
  message in place of `Invalid body`.

- **Two adjacent attendance screens no longer shout a status at different volumes.** The reconciled-
  days table pre-split `ON_LEAVE` into `"ON LEAVE"` before handing it to `Pill`, which defeated the
  shared `enumLabel` (it only recognises the underscored form) — so it printed `ON LEAVE` where the
  history table, one tab away and reading the same rows, printed `On leave`. Same slip in the
  heatmap tooltip. Both now pass the raw enum through the one humaniser, and the two hard-coded
  strings beside them go through `tr`.

- **Attendance history, analytics and payroll-ready export (clock-in revamp PR 2).** Every user
  can now see their own attendance and download it, and HR can do the same for the set they pick.
  `GET /attendance/analytics` (+ `/mine`), `GET /attendance/export` (+ `/mine`) and
  `GET /attendance/punches/mine` are new; the log list gains `employee_ids` and `department`, and
  `daysFor` takes a compare set of up to 50. The summarizer (`attendance.analytics`) is pure —
  punctuality, hours from in/out, lateness, absences, on-site %, leave/holiday/off counts,
  department rollup, per-employee compare rows and heatmap cells — and takes expected working days
  ONLY from PR1's calendar resolver, never from the reconciled status (a punch on a non-working day
  reconciles as `PRESENT`, so the status cannot answer "was this owed as work"). Waived days are
  reported apart from charged ones. The export (`attendance.export`) renders Days + Punches through
  the house spreadsheet toolkit — branded, currency-aware, injection-safe — with the guide's exact
  column keys frozen and pinned by a test, because payroll parses them; CSV honours `?sheet=`,
  the file is `attendance-{from}-{to}.{ext}` (SANDBOX-suffixed in Test), and rows are hard-capped
  at 20k with the truncation reported rather than silently applied. One shared `AttendanceHistory`
  widget — period chips (7d/month/quarter/year/custom), KPI row, heatmap over expected working
  days, a day table where leave, holidays and days off are first-class rows, and CSV/XLSX download
  — is mounted on My HR (self, `/mine`), Human capital → Attendance as a new "History & analytics"
  tab, and the employee 360 Attendance tab, which it replaces the raw punch list on. Waive/uphold
  stays on the HR rows that carry a deduction, raising the same dialog the reconciled-days view
  uses. The day-window validator moves from 92 days to 366 so the year view and the past-year
  download stop being a 422; the cost argument the day cap used to carry alone now sits on the row
  ceiling, where the cost actually is.

- **Certified signatures (Signature Programme PR-4, Tier 3).** The `CERTIFIED` card is live end
  to end: a counterparty who picks it is handed to the provider (SignWell, the only V1 adapter,
  behind a provider-agnostic interface) which verifies their identity and emails them its own
  secure link; on the provider's completion — webhook or the 30-minute poll backstop — the signed
  PDF and the provider's audit certificate are mirrored into the vault, one `QES`/`PROVIDER`
  signature is written with the provider's bytes as the artifact hash, and the chain advances with
  the next link emailed. Envelopes are metered in `signature_usage_ledger` (migrations
  `10785`–`10787`), charged in the same transaction as the provider reference so a provider
  failure is never billable, and the platform quota watch alerts at 80% / 95% of the monthly
  allowance, once per threshold per month. The webhook is signature-verified on the raw body
  (constant-time, replay-windowed) and idempotent — a replayed event writes one signature, not
  two. Platform Console → Integrations gains the SignWell account + pricing; Settings →
  Signatures gains the read-only "Certified signatures" panel (provider state, this tenant's
  monthly count, no figure). A request being voided cancels its in-flight envelopes; the ledger
  row stays, because the provider consumed the quota whatever we do.
- **Attendance now follows the entity's working calendar, and says what it
  actually knows about a punch's location.** Expected working days resolve
  employee override → the entity's working calendar (its own, or the inherited
  tenant default) → the tenant weekend, so a Mon–Sat yard is no longer marked
  absent every Saturday and charged for a day nobody asked it to work; the
  reconciler and the daily-rate arithmetic use that one resolver, so the day
  and the settlement cannot disagree. The attendance log and provisional
  absence now select punches by a **local-zone window** instead of the UTC
  date, so a 00:30 Douala punch stops landing on the previous day. Punches
  also record **what the device presented** (`location_source`, migration
  10740) separately from whether a worksite existed to judge it: "we never got
  a fix" and "GPS arrived, but this tenant has drawn no geofence" were both
  painted "No fix", which taught people to ignore the one signal that matters.
  HR Today now shows No GPS / Off-site / On-site / No worksite as four
  different things. The clock still punches when GPS is refused — the tenant
  policy decides whether that is acceptable, not the browser — and then offers
  a recovery panel with the OS steps, a Retry and an install prompt.
- **Treasury accounts can be corrected in place.** Master data → Treasury →
  any account now has an **Edit** button next to Verify/Deactivate, opening the
  same category-driven form the account was created with, pre-filled. A typo'd
  account number, a missing zero on the opening balance, a wrong IBAN or
  statement day is a correction, not a reason to deactivate the account and
  open a second one — a treasury account is never deleted (its class-5 CoA leaf
  is referenced by journal history), so before this the mistake was permanent
  in the UI. The `PATCH /treasury-accounts/:id` endpoint already existed and
  nothing called it. Entity and category stay locked, because the CoA leaf is
  already minted under the category's parent; renaming the account still
  renames its leaf. Emptying a field now clears it rather than leaving the old
  value behind, and editing a *verified* account warns that the verification
  stamp is not cleared automatically.

- **The employee 360° is now the full record (10708).** The profile grew
  Payroll (payslips per period with the standard PDF), Advances (amount,
  recovered, outstanding and the recovery plan) and Sanctions tabs, and the
  Contracts tab gained **Renew**: one click creates a NEW draft contract that
  supersedes the signed one — terms carried over, new term starting the day
  after the old one ends and keeping its length, both dates overridable. The
  signed wording is never copied into the renewal, because it carries the old
  dates; the new DRAFT is exactly the state redrafting exists for.
- **Appraisals gained manual scoring beside the AI score.** Each KPI line in a
  review now has an editable rating input the manager types into (commit on
  Enter/blur, ✕ to clear and follow the evidence suggestion again). The
  manager's number and the evidence-derived suggestion stay in separate
  columns permanently — a human may disagree with the model, and the system
  now records when they did (`rated_at`).
- **SOPs are documents you can read and draft.** The "New SOP" form collects
  the facts the company knows — scope, owning role, effective date, the
  purpose in their own words and the steps they already have — and the AI
  writes the standard professional document (Purpose, Scope, Responsibilities,
  Procedure, Records, Compliance) around them, never inventing a clause the
  company didn't state; where the material is thin the document says
  "To be completed:" instead of guessing. Clicking any procedure in the
  register opens the generated document, editable and re-draftable, with a
  Render PDF step that files it in the vault.
- **Trainings record the whole meeting.** A "Record meeting" button on the
  session panel starts before the meeting and captures everything; the stream
  is sliced every ~25 s, each slice transcribed and appended to the session's
  transcript, and "Draft minutes with AI" folds the transcript + notes into
  the minutes. The trainings screen also gained bottom padding so the last
  table no longer sits flush against the viewport edge.
- **Delivery prefill now picks up GROUPED containers.** A file that states
  "3 × 40' HC" (container lines, no per-box numbers yet) now prefills the
  delivery note with that line — type, quantity and remaining count — and the
  printed manifest renders it as the file states it. Boxes another note
  already covers are flagged (`already_on`) and no longer auto-ticked, so a
  twice-delivered box is a deliberate split load, not an accident.
- **The milestones Templates tab is now a register you can act on.** Each
  template lists its service type, version, stage count and every stage with
  its due offset, weight, owner tier and flags (anchor, SLA-locked, internal
  only, needs proof, auto-advance) — with a plain-English explanation of what
  a template does. And the dead list is dead no longer: **New template**
  publishes a first chain for any service type from this screen (the picker
  surfaces the ones with no chain), **Edit chain** opens the full stage editor
  seeded from the CURRENT version — so re-publishing does not silently revert
  it to the shipped default — and **Activate** rolls a superseded version back
  instead of minting a byte-identical new one.

- **Partnership and vendor applications are vetted, and an approved vendor
  stops being re-typed (F10).** `partnership_request` was five columns against a
  form that vets forwarding agents: no country, no contact title, and no
  network memberships — which is the field an agent is actually vetted on. It
  now carries all three (memberships as a jsonb array, GIN-indexed, so "who
  claims WCA" is one query), the applicant's corporate profile as a vault
  document rather than a filename concatenated onto a public directory in the
  browser, capped internal notes, and a decision that records who made it and
  why (a rejection without a reason is refused by the database). The status
  vocabulary moves to the legacy API's own NEW / IN_REVIEW / APPROVED /
  REJECTED and existing rows are translated, so one state does not end up with
  two names. Approving a VENDOR_REGISTRATION now opens a DRAFT supplier in the
  same transaction — the legacy printed "approved vendors must be manually
  onboarded", which is a limitation dressed as a control; the real control is
  that a DRAFT supplier has no auxiliary accounting account and, as of this
  change, cannot be put on a purchase order until somebody holding the approve
  permission verifies it. An existing supplier of the same name is reused, and
  a unique index makes that true under concurrency. An agency partnership opens
  a supplier only when the approver asks. New register at /sales/partnerships
  with the four KPI tiles computed from two partitions the API proves add up.
  Migration `0688_sales_crm_f10_partnership.sql`.
- **BREAKING:** `/api/tenant/intake/partnerships*` → `/api/tenant/partnership-requests*`.
  Partnership requests are their own module (`sales/partnership_request`);
  contact enquiries keep `/intake/enquiries`. Nothing in `client/` called the
  old paths. The AI manifest key `review_partnership` is now
  `review_partnership_request`, plus `get_partnership_request`,
  `create_partnership_request` and `approve_partnership_request` — re-run
  `node scripts/ai/sync-actions.js` to rebuild `ai_action_catalogue`.
- **Operation-file references stop being guessable.** A dossier reference is the
  one number in this system a CLIENT holds, and it was sequential:
  `SLAS-OPS-2026-0142` tells whoever holds it how many files we opened this year,
  roughly where theirs sits, and that `…-0141` and `…-0143` are worth trying. New
  files now get `SL7Z3K9QW2M4XBSM` — an entity prefix, a 60-bit
  `crypto.randomBytes` core in Crockford Base32, and a service-type code — which
  is the legacy `SL6721864SM` convention modernised rather than discarded. The
  allocator owns generate → write → retry as one step, so the unique index on
  `dossier.ref` is the only thing that decides a collision (a savepoint per
  attempt, because a 23505 otherwise poisons the caller's transaction). References
  are allocated by the backend alone: `service.create` used to take one from its
  payload, which three of its four callers — including the AI action registry —
  could set. Once allocated a reference never changes: updates that carry a
  different `ref` are refused, and status, service-type and entity changes leave it
  alone. **Financial and statutory numbering is untouched** — invoices, receipts,
  journal entries and tax documents keep their gap-free `doc_sequence` numbers,
  which is what reconciliation needs. Every existing reference stays valid, nothing
  is rewritten, and search reaches all three schemes (including the display
  spelling `SL-7Z3K9QW2M4XB-SM`). Entity prefixes and service codes are seeded for
  existing rows by migration `0682`, editable until the first file uses them, and
  audited when changed — on the entity dossier and the Service Type form
  respectively.
- **Structured client discovery on meetings (MOD-21, Sales & CRM F1).** A
  meeting against a lead is now captured in the three named sections of the
  Client Discovery Framework — business and operations context, pain points,
  proposed strategy — instead of one free-text box, because those three sections
  are what a proposal is later drafted from and free text is not data. Each can
  be typed or dictated; dictation runs through the existing `ai-transcribe`
  worker, which is the half that was missing (`meeting.transcript_vault_id` used
  to be read off the request body, so the flag "this meeting has a transcript"
  was an assertion the caller made about itself — only the worker writes it now).
  The scripted probing questions above each box are seeded rows in EN and FR,
  editable per tenant, not markup. Meeting location is captured. A section whose
  audio failed to transcribe says so on the record rather than sitting blank, and
  a lead's latest discovery set is one call (`GET /meetings/discovery/lead/:id`).
  Migration `0681_meeting_discovery.sql`.

- **Change your own password (`POST /api/tenant/auth/change-password`).** The
  third leg of the password story, and the one that was missing: recovery by
  email covered "locked out" and `POST /users/:id/password` covered "someone
  else's account", but an ordinary user who simply wanted a different password
  had no route — the admin one is behind the MOD-67 edit grant, so most users
  could only rotate their credential by mailing themselves a reset link, and
  only while outbound mail was healthy. The new endpoint verifies the current
  password with the same Argon2id compare login uses (a live access token is
  deliberately not sufficient proof), applies the full password policy to the new
  one, voids any outstanding reset links, and force-signs-out every OTHER session
  while keeping the caller's. Rate limited per user, not per IP — the caller has
  already proved who they are, so the only budget a key can exhaust is their own.
  Surfaced as a **Password** card on Security → My security.

- **Tax rates & jurisdictions is now a working 360 (MOD-07).** The screen that
  feeds every invoice's VAT/WHT postings — account determination reads the
  effective-dated `tax_code` at the entry date — becomes a jurisdiction → dossier
  master-detail, with a tab per tax family (TVA / IS / retenues / paie / autre)
  showing each code's current effective rate and full version timeline. Fixes the
  write path that made no-code amendment impossible: the Add-code **Kind** dropdown
  sent `TVA/IS/MIN_TAX/PATENTE` — values the API enum rejects — so TVA and IS
  codes could not be created from the UI at all; kinds are now the canonical
  `VAT/WHT/INCOME/PAYROLL/OTHER` shown with Cameroon labels (the instrument stays
  in the Code field). Adds GL posting-account pickers, a base-rule field, and a
  **structured brackets/caps editor** for the IRPP progressive scale, CNPS caps and
  work-injury risk classes (previously seed-only JSON). A new **Amend rate** action
  wires the existing atomic `supersedeCode` to
  `POST /tax-jurisdictions/:id/codes/supersede` — expire the current row, open the
  new one, in one transaction — so a Finance-Law change is a new version, never an
  overwrite.
- **Counterparty governance (PR3-C).** The dedup detection shipped in §5.1 now
  has its UI (an amber "Possible duplicates" panel on both create forms and at
  the top of the 360), plus: a **governed merge** (`party_merge/`) that
  reattaches every FK loser→survivor by catalogue discovery, preserves the
  loser's names as `party_alias` rows, soft-archives the loser
  (`registration_status='ARCHIVED'`, `merged_into_id`) rather than deleting it,
  deactivates its aux account and re-points its open compliance flags —
  CEO/Admin only, routed through a maker-checker in Live; **copy-from-origin**
  for a converted party (`cloneFromOrigin`); 360 **deep links**, inline-SVG
  **charts** and the **supplier AVL scorecard**; an audited **masked-bank
  reveal**; a **sensitive-field maker-checker** (bank / legal name / tax
  registration / credit limit / status changes become pending change requests in
  Live, applied on a second authorization); and a transactional
  `compliance.assertAllowed` **gate** wired at dossier and PO creation
  (migration `0517`).

### Security

- Access tokens now respect session revocation — killing a session, the idle
  timeout, or refresh-reuse detection ends the token immediately rather than
  leaving it valid for up to 15 minutes (`SEC-M1`).
- The Socket.IO handshake resolves the tenant from the Host header in
  production; a client can no longer name its own tenant (`SEC-M4`).
- The `runtime` and `worker` containers run as an unprivileged user instead of
  root (`SEC-L1`). **Operational note:** the first deploy after this chowns
  `./media`, `./uploads`, `./logs` and `./data` to uid 1000.

### Added

- **Delivery notes: whole-row click opens the snapshot modal, and the document page shows the real note in the app theme.** The delivery-notes list now opens its detail modal on a click anywhere in the row (the same `onRowClick` gesture as the transit-orders list, with the ref cell as the keyboard/AT activator). The document page (`/documents/DELIVERY_NOTE/:id` and `/documents/TRANSIT_ORDER/:id`) gains bespoke **native** renderers — consignee, delivery details, container manifest, cargo, reservations and the named received-by block for delivery notes; shipment facts, five-column cargo with declared value, customs regime, insurance/surveyor elections and the attached-document checklist for transit orders — block-for-block with the PDF template but rendered in the app theme, since the white print sheet does not blend with the dark UI. The generic card body was the defect for these two documents: it had no vocabulary for containers, reservations, vessel, regime or checklist. Download PDF is unchanged (vaulted, QR-verifiable). Edit-while-DRAFT was already fully wired (detail modal Edit button gated on `DRAFT` → `PATCH /delivery-notes/:id` with header + lines + containers; `rules.EDITABLE` is exactly `{DRAFT}`) and is verified end-to-end by the delivery-note lifecycle tests.

### Added

- **System-email fallback sender** (the two-config email model, `doc/EMAIL_TWO_CONFIGS.md`). System emails (OTP, invites, invoices, notifications) now fall back to a Praxis-owned sender — `no-reply@praxisls.com` / `support@praxisls.com` — sent through the deploy-wide SMTP when a tenant hasn't configured their own mail, so tenants who haven't pointed their DNS at us never lose system mail. The fallback is configured + live-tested in the **Platform Console → Integrations → System-email fallback sender** (platform `mail.fallback` setting, password encrypted at rest), with env `SMTP_*` / `MAIL_*` as last-resort defaults (`migration 0091`). Fixed `MAIL_DEFAULT_FROM` being referenced but undefined; `MAIL_FALLBACK_DOMAIN` default is now `praxisls.com`.
- **Mailbox is now reachable in the Comms workstation**: `Comms → Mailbox` (`/comms/mail`) mounts the existing provider-agnostic mailbox UI (Microsoft 365 / Google / IMAP-SMTP, inbound + outbound) alongside Smart Comms chat and Setup; `Comms → Setup` now explains the two-config split (system email vs mailbox) and the fallback.
- `dossier.title` — the sales→operations handoff has never worked, because two
  services wrote a column the table did not have (`NEW-08`, migration `0508`).
- Backend coverage is measured in CI, with the threshold expressed in functions
  rather than lines (`TC-CI3`, `TC-Q1`).
- `.env.example` is reconciled against the config schema in CI, and the
  environment is now validated _before_ migrations rather than after
  (`TC-E1`).
- Destructive migrations must carry an explicit `-- DESTRUCTIVE:` marker
  (`OBS-I3`).
- Deploys record which commit shipped, when, by whom, and whether they finished
  (`TC-R3`); a deploy can be pinned to a named commit (`TC-D7`); an opt-in
  `AUTO_ROLLBACK=1` reverts a build that fails its readiness gate (`OBS-I4`).

### Changed

- Lint blocks the build, as a ratchet against the current warning count rather
  than an unachievable zero (`TC-CI10`).
- `npm audit` blocks at high severity, with a dated exception for the known
  `exceljs` transitive finding instead of a permanent bypass (`TC-CI4`).
- CI has a concurrency group, so two rapid pushes no longer produce two deploys
  ordered by completion time (`TC-D8`).

### Fixed

- **The deliverability and signature surfaces no longer gate the whole `/mail` namespace.** Both routers mounted at `/mail` — the same base path as every mail module — carried a router-level `router.use(requireFeature("mail.<surface>"))`, and the module loader mounts them in alphabetical discovery order (deliverability third, signature sixth). A router-level gate runs for EVERY `/mail/*` request that falls through to that router, including paths it does not own: a tenant that switched `mail.deliverability` off got `403 FEATURE_DISABLED` for `GET /mail/threads`, `GET /mail/folders`, `GET /mail/mailboxes/mine` and every module mounted after deliverability (signature, triage) before they reached the router that owns them; with `mail.deliverability` on and `mail.signatures` off it was triage's shared-inbox claim/assign instead. Both flags ship ON (migration `9114`), so the outage was latent — the same inverted pattern as the `mail.ai` gate fix in this list, armed for the first operator to switch one off. The gate is now a per-route middleware on each `/deliverability*` route and each `/signature*` route — the pattern triage already uses for `mail.shared_inbox` / `mail.followup` / `mail.secure_links`. Pinned by `tests/security/mail-gate-scope-deliverability-signature.test.js` (written first, watched fail — six failures on the broken code: three inbox reads behind deliverability-off, a triage claim behind signature-off, and the both-off worst case, plus the per-own-flag refusal assertions; 20/20 green after the fix).
- **The compose entry points are discoverable.** The Comms hub (`/comms`) was
  the only surface with a compose entry — a bare 16px `+` glyph behind a
  tooltip — and the new Mail Inbox (`/comms/mail`) had none at all (reply-only;
  only the legacy "Message log" tab had one). The hub header now renders a real
  button (icon + "New" label on `md` and up, icon-only on narrow screens) that
  opens the existing new-message chooser (in-house message / group channel /
  email), and the Inbox header gains a Compose button (icon + label on `sm`
  and up, icon-only on narrow screens; disabled while the user has no
  `CONNECTED` mailbox) that opens the existing `ComposeModal`. The resulting
  `InboxPage ↔ mail.tsx` module cycle is safe — `ComposeModal` is a hoisted
  function declaration — and is documented in the commit message.
- **An empty mail can no longer reach a recipient.** The inbox composer could
  send a message whose body serialized to an 823-byte empty HTML shell
  (`compose.serialize` wraps any doc — even an empty paragraph — in a full
  HTML document), and the outbox's `if (!html && !text) throw` guard saw the
  shell and let it through; the IMAP/SMTP provider then dropped the empty
  `text` part (`""` collapses to `undefined` via `||`), so the recipient got a
  subject with no content. The outbox now checks *visible* content (strip
  `<style>` blocks, strip tags, collapse whitespace, allow a real `<img>`):
  a message with no visible text and no image is refused with 422 "a message
  needs a body" before it is queued. Quote-only replies and image-only
  messages still pass. Client-side, the inbox Send button now requires a
  non-empty editor (a quote counts as content) and the legacy ComposeModal
  disables Send on a blank body. Pinned by new `mail-outbox.test.js` cases:
  empty and whitespace-only docs refused, quote-only and image-only enqueued.
- **The mailbox no longer disappears when Mail AI is off.** The `mail.ai` feature
  gate was applied router-wide (`router.use(...)`) on the `mail/assist` router,
  which is mounted at `/mail` — the same base path as every other mail module,
  and the first of them the module loader mounts (alphabetical discovery). The
  gate therefore ran for EVERY `/mail/*` request that fell through to that
  router: with AI off (this flag's default), `GET /mail/threads`,
  `GET /mail/folders` and `GET /mail/mailboxes/mine` answered
  `403 FEATURE_DISABLED` before they reached `mail.routes.js` — the whole inbox
  was unreachable for every tenant that had not opted into AI, while the
  Platform Console correctly showed "Mail AI: off". The gate is now a per-route
  middleware on each `/assist/*` route: the AI surface keeps its protection,
  OCR extraction keeps BOTH (the `mail.ai` floor and its own `mail.ocr` gate),
  and the rest of `/mail` is left to the module that owns the path. The one
  route outside `/assist` (`GET /mail/messages/:id/extractions`) is gated by
  `mail.ocr` alone — not a loss of the floor, because the catalogue row for
  `mail.ocr` depends on `mail.ai` (migration `9114`). Pinned by
  `tests/security/mail-ai-gate-scope.test.js` (written first, watched fail —
  three 403s on the broken code) and the re-scoped gate assertions in
  `tests/unit/mail-ai-routes.test.js`.
- **The certified-signature webhook now receives genuine deliveries (PR-4 remediation).** The
  global `express.json()` in `server.js` parsed every JSON body before the webhook's route-level
  text parser could run (body-parser sets `req._body`, and downstream parsers bail on it), so
  `verifyWebhook` only ever saw a parsed object and rejected every real SignWell delivery with
  401 — certified signatures could only settle through the poll backstop, at best an hour late.
  The global parser now stashes the untouched bytes on `req.rawBody` (its `verify` callback),
  the controller reads the raw form first and refuses re-serialisation (a re-serialised body is
  not the body the signature covers), and the route header describes the plumbing that actually
  exists. Proven by a new stack-level test that POSTs a genuinely signed payload through
  `buildApp()` with `Content-Type: application/json` — written first and watched fail (401)
  against the broken code — including the 401 for a forged hash and the idempotent replay.
- **Credential resolution is tenant-named on every path (PR-4 remediation).** The QES
  credential cache keyed on the ambient request context with a shared `"_"` fallback — and
  workers have no request context, so the poll backstop let the first tenant polled in a
  5-minute window populate a slot every other tenant then read: one tenant's SignWell key
  answering another tenant's question, `credential_source` wrong on the audit rows, and other
  tenants' envelopes unable to advance at all. `providerConfig` now takes the tenant
  explicitly (the poll and completion paths name their slug), the ambient context is a
  request-path convenience, and a call that names no tenant computes its answer and does not
  cache it — a slot that cannot identify its tenant is a miss, never a shared seat.
- **A failed envelope charge no longer strands the retry (PR-4 remediation).** On a handoff
  charge failure the envelope row (inserted before the `BEGIN`) survived the rollback as
  `CREATING` — an in-flight state that `uq_qes_active_party` and `getActiveForParty` both
  cover — so the "please try again" advice threw `ENVELOPE_IN_FLIGHT` for the next hour. The
  row now transitions to `FAILED` with the reason in the rollback path, so the retry is
  possible immediately and the poll has nothing to clean up. The ledger-on-cancel decision
  (provider document cancelled, no ledger row for an envelope nobody can use) is recorded in
  the guide's §7.0 deviation table.
- **The webhook timestamp window is asymmetric and the shape is defensive
  (PR-4 remediation).** `Math.abs` accepted an event stamped 15 minutes in the future exactly
  as readily as a replay 15 minutes old; backward is now the 15-minute replay window and
  forward a 2-minute clock-skew allowance. A numeric-string `event.time` is coerced and logged
  once, so a provider payload-shape change cannot fail every webhook closed with no signal
  distinguishing it from a forgery.
- **The QES poll no longer strands envelopes invisibly when the provider key is missing
  (PR-4 remediation).** A tenant that removes its key previously left every in-flight envelope
  open behind a per-envelope `logger.warn` — the shape that gets scrolled past. The key is
  now read once per sweep; when it is missing each affected envelope carries the reason in
  `last_error` (the durable record) and one alert goes out per tenant per sweep through the
  platform alert channels. The envelopes stay open: the poll advances them the moment the key
  is back.
- **The migration-scoping gate now covers the programme's `qes` files and
  `pg_trigger` lookups (PR-4 remediation).** `10785_qes_envelope.sql` and
  `10787_qes_events.sql` did not match the gate's file pattern, so they were outside the net
  for every future edit. The pattern now covers `qes` (applied files are not renamed — the
  ledger keys on filename), and the gate reads `pg_trigger` lookups as well as
  `pg_constraint`: the same database-wide catalog class, and it found a real one — 10781's
  name-only trigger check (PR-3) skipped the sandbox trigger on every provisioned tenant,
  leaving `signature_request.updated_at` dead in the sandbox. 10781 is applied and immutable,
  so the scoped repair lands in 10787 (the 10779 pattern), and the test grandfathering 10781's
  line asserts the repair exists, so the exemption cannot outlive the fix.
- **The external signing chain no longer stops silently at the second signature.** The public
  `/complete` passed no mailer to the chain advance, so after a counterparty signed, the next
  party was marked `SENT` with a token minted and nowhere delivered — and the tenant's "send next
  link" button could not find them, because it looks for `PENDING` parties. The chain advanced and
  stopped, silently, at the second signature. `signature_public.controller` now injects the same
  dispatcher the internal dispatch uses, so the next link goes out by email on every external
  completion (and it must, for the QES path, where a webhook has no operator to press the button).
  Found and closed on the way during PR-4; the QES wiring tests pin it.
- **Silent-catch ratchet after #228.** Adding lines to `explainSendError` moved
  three grandfathered empty catches in `mail.service.js` off
  `doc/silent-catch-baseline.json` (`file:line`), so `build-test` failed on
  `main` with three “NEW” sites. Classified the leftover swallows in place —
  Graph `getConnection` / `autoLink` / attachment skip / optional `setupPush`
  as `@silent:storage`, `markRead` logger require as `@silent:teardown` —
  instead of re-blessing the baseline.

- **SMTP sender-verify is no longer a Praxis 5xx.** Two classifiers survived
  the same merge: `mapSmtpError` labelled `550 Sender verify failed` as 502
  `SMTP_SENDER_REJECTED` (Test, system email, platform mail-fallback probe,
  inbound-intake reply), while mailbox compose used 422 `SENDER_NOT_AUTHORIZED`.
  The 502 path flooded the server-error monitor with a mailbox-config fault.
  One map now, classified by evidence not SMTP family: sender-verify / relay
  denied → 422 `SENDER_NOT_AUTHORIZED`; user-unknown → 422 `RECIPIENT_REJECTED`;
  535 / `EAUTH` → auth; 421/451/452 → transient 502. A bare 550 is no longer
  called a sender fault. Compose still names the connected mailbox.

- **PDF preview on client / supplier / corporate-entity document uploads showed
  Chrome's "This content is blocked" interstitial.** `FileDrop` previewed a
  picked PDF in a `sandbox=""` iframe pointed at a `data:` URL. Chrome's built-in
  PDF viewer is a plugin, so Helmet's default `object-src 'none'` and the empty
  sandbox (no plugin token exists) both refuse it — images kept working because
  they render in `<img>`. Previews now paint pages onto a canvas via pdf.js
  (loaded on demand, left out of the vendor chunk) so the operator can confirm
  they picked the right scan before submitting. A render failure still offers
  "Open in a new tab", which is top-level navigation and is not subject to
  `object-src`.
- **Saved dates came back blank on every edit form, and could not be re-saved
  (`NEW-11`).** node-postgres parsed a `date` column into a JS `Date` at midnight
  in the API's timezone, so `res.json()` sent `2021-09-20T23:00:00.000Z` for a
  registration issued on the 21st: the wrong day, in a format
  `<input type="date">` cannot render. Re-opening a corporate entity or one of
  its registrations, documents or tax registrations therefore showed an empty
  Issued on / Expires on for dates that were saved, and pressing Save posted the
  timestamp back — `issued_on: Use the format YYYY-MM-DD., That date doesn't
exist.` on a field nobody had touched. `date` columns now arrive as the
  `YYYY-MM-DD` string Postgres sent (`src/shared/db/pg-date-types.js`), which is
  the format the shared `isoDate` schema validates and the date inputs expect, so
  the value round-trips unchanged. `dateFmt` reads a bare date as a calendar date
  rather than a UTC instant, and the entity and nested-child forms normalise
  whatever they are seeded with, so a timestamp reaching a date control degrades
  to the right day instead of a blank box. Applies to every `date` column in the
  product, not only master data; `timestamptz` columns are unaffected.
- `win({ createDossier })` and the `opportunity.won` handler both 500'd or
  dead-lettered on every run (`NEW-08`).
- Client test suite: a test that could only run on Linux, a Zod instance split,
  a timezone-dependent assertion, and a shell rendered without the app's
  providers (`NEW-12`).
