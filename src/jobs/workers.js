/**
 * Background worker runtime (BullMQ consumer).
 *
 * The producer side (jobs/queue.js, jobs/queue-producer.js) already lets any
 * process enqueue durable jobs; this is the consumer that actually runs them.
 * It was a 0-byte stub — any job enqueued would have sat in Redis forever with
 * nothing to process it (doc/PHASE0_PRODUCTION_AUDIT.md).
 *
 * To add a job type (Phase 1's PDF/email/FX are first), register it in
 * PROCESSORS below — the runtime spins up a BullMQ Worker for it, wires
 * concurrency, structured logging, and graceful shutdown. No queue is invented
 * here; the registry ships empty and is the single, obvious extension point. The
 * process idles cleanly if nothing is registered, so it is safe to deploy now.
