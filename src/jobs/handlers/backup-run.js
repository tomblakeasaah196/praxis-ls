/**
 * Backup jobs (INFRASTRUCTURE_PLAN §3.2, WS-B1 / WS-B3).
 *
 * One queue, three behaviours, matching the shape error-maintenance and
 * health-collect already use:
 *
 *   "fleet" — pg_dump every LIVE tenant to offsite storage, one row per attempt
 *             in platform.backup_run. Nightly, BACKUP_CRON.
 *   "prune" — apply D4's retention (30 daily, 12 weekly). Runs after "fleet" so
 *             a night that failed to produce a new dump does not delete the old
 *             one it was supposed to replace.
 *   "drill" — restore the least-recently-drilled tenant into a scratch database,
 *             verify it, record the measured RTO, drop the scratch. Monthly,
 *             RESTORE_DRILL_CRON.
 *
 * WHY THE DRILL IS A JOB AND NOT A RUNBOOK STEP
 *
 *   Because a runbook step is a thing someone means to do. §3.2's whole finding
 *   is that a backup nobody has restored is not a backup, and the only way that
 *   stops being true is if the restore happens on a schedule without anyone
 *   deciding to run it. A drill that requires a human to remember it inherits
 *   exactly the failure mode it exists to remove.
 *
 * THIS HANDLER THROWS ON FAILURE, DELIBERATELY — unlike health-collect, which
 * never throws because a failed probe IS its data. Here a failed backup or a
 * failed drill is a terminal failure that must reach the error reporter and the
 * alert channel: workers.js wraps every handler with duration, request-id and
 * terminal-failure reporting, and this is precisely the job class that should
 * page someone. A silent backup failure is the exact condition that turns a
 * recoverable incident into an unrecoverable one.
