/**
 * Kaizen ops sweeps (§3.1, §3.4, §3.5) — WS-H1/H2, WS-U1, WS-ER1.
 *
 * One queue, four behaviours, matching the shape the other schedulers use:
 *
 *   "health"  — snapshot every tenant's health into platform.tenant_health,
 *               including the synthetic per-tenant liveness probe (WS-H2).
 *   "uptime"  — probe every host over HTTP and record the sample (WS-U1).
 *   "alert"   — evaluate the current ops state and route what it warrants to a
 *               channel (WS-ER1). Separate from the sweeps that produce the
 *               data so that alerting cadence is tunable independently of
 *               collection cadence — you want to MEASURE often and NOTIFY
 *               rarely, and collapsing them forces one interval to be both.
 *   "purge"   — retention for the two time-series.
 *
 * NEVER THROWS on the collection paths. A failed probe is the data point; a
 * handler that rejects goes onto BullMQ's retry/backoff path and skips the very
 * samples that make an outage visible. Same reasoning as health-collect.js, and
 * the deliberate opposite of backup-run.js, where a failure IS the alert.
