 * Captured at `notice`, which is what makes honouring the requirement safe. A
 * 422 is a client mistake, not a fault, and routing them at `error` would bury
 * real failures under "email is required" and get the alert channel muted. At
 * `notice` the reporter records and counts but never posts to the webhook and
 * never spends the rate limit (see NOTIFY_SEVERITIES), and escalation rules
 * default to `fatal`, so nothing pages.
 *
 * The message is SYNTHESISED rather than passed through. A ZodError's own
 * `message` is a JSON dump of every issue, which would be unreadable in the feed
 * and — worse — would fingerprint differently for every combination of bad
 * fields, so one broken form would produce hundreds of separate groups. Keying
 * on the route plus the sorted field names makes "this endpoint keeps getting
 * bad input for these fields" ONE row with a rising count, which is the only
 * shape in which this data is worth anything.

  // tenant slug", "needs at least one posting rule" — reached the consumer as
