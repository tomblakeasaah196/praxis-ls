 * WHY `is_live` IS NOT PART OF THIS ANY MORE (2026-09-29). It used to read
 * `!tenant.is_live && requested === "sandbox"`: once a tenant had been switched
 * live in the platform console, TEST was switched off — SILENTLY. The client
 * never learns `is_live`, so the TEST chip stayed on screen while every request
 * behind it was answered from, and wrote to, LIVE. A person creating "test"
 * employees on a live tenant was hiring real ones.
 *
 * The owner's decision is that TEST keeps working after go-live — it is where
 * a live tenant tries things on its real people (migration 14250 copies them in)
 * — so the header decides, whatever `is_live` says. What still protects LIVE is
 * that it is the DEFAULT: anything but an explicit "sandbox" is live.

  /**
   * PERF S2 — one connection per request, not three.
   *
   * Measured: `auth.js` takes a connection, `rbac.js` takes another, the
   * controller takes a third. Each pays `pool.connect()` plus a
   * `SET search_path` round-trip, so effective concurrency was
   * `pool_max / 3` ≈ 2.7 in-flight requests per tenant, and throughput
   * plateaued at ~1,200 req/s while p50 grew 14× under load — textbook
   * queueing on a saturated pool.
   *
   * The connection is acquired LAZILY, on first use, so a request that never
   * touches the database (a 404, a static asset, a health probe) holds
   * nothing. It is released when the response finishes.
   *
   * TWO CONSEQUENCES WORTH BEING EXPLICIT ABOUT:
   *
   * 1. `tenantDb` and `identityDb` now share one connection. Under LIVE they
   *    already wanted the same schema, so this costs nothing. Under sandbox
   *    they differ, and `registry.acquire` re-binds the search_path on each
   *    switch — one SET where there used to be a checkout AND a SET.
   *
   * 2. Two db calls in the same request are no longer isolated from each
   *    other. That is a fix, not a regression: code that assumed otherwise was
   *    already relying on two separate connections silently being two separate
   *    transactions. Verified before making this change that nothing runs
   *    `req.tenantDb` calls concurrently (no Promise.all over them anywhere in
   *    src/), so the serialisation `pg` imposes on a shared client changes no
   *    existing behaviour.
   *
   * A long-running handler now holds its connection for the whole response.
   * `req.releaseDb()` is the escape hatch for a handler that is done with the
   * database and still has work to do — streaming a large export, say.
