// backstop that lived here and the synchronous call in costing.service.
// A costing is a BUDGET raised by an operations officer; the final invoice is
// raised by a finance officer from the accepted quotation, which is where its
// prices come from (`final_invoice.assertPricedSource`). A document that
// silently creates another department's document is a control weakness, and
// the invoice it opened was an empty shell nobody had asked for.

// caller, so those grants outlived the account.

// employee's phone no longer rings for calls or shows chat notifications.

// ── Mail dossier drawer (PR-3 §7.5) ──
// The four events the guide names as making a cached drawer wrong. Registered
// from one list so the cache module and the handlers cannot drift: add an event
// to `context-cache.INVALIDATING_EVENTS` and it is wired here.

// ── Resolved decisions — intentionally NOT auto-wired (not pending) ──
//  Payroll run → GL-only (company-wide 661/664). Dossier labour is DRIVER TIME,
//    attributed per-job from fleet_dispatch above (PRD §6.7/§1093) — a blanket
//    split off the payroll run would be an accounting fiction.
//  Commercial documents are deliberate human steps, so they stay operator-driven:
//   • proposal.accepted → quotation — opt-in `accept({createQuotation})` (pricing is a decision).
//   • quotation.accepted → invoice  — opt-in `accept({convert})`; the dossier's DRAFT invoice
//       is already produced by costing.approved (one-draft-per-dossier).
//   • purchase_request.approved → PO — the buyer selects supplier/terms when raising the PO.
//   • lead.converted → opportunity   — already handled in-service by lead conversion.
