/**
 * Shared rate limiters.
 *
 * Audit SEC-C3 (2026-08-04): `/auth/login`, `/auth/refresh`, `/auth/2fa/verify`
 * and `/auth/pin/login` had NO limiter. `forgot-password` and `reset-password`
 * did — so the recovery surface was protected while the surface you attack
 * first was not. Password guessing, refresh-token guessing, TOTP guessing (a
 * six-digit space) and PIN guessing were all unthrottled.
 *
 * Audit SEC-H5, fixed in the same pass because fixing C3 alone would have
 * shipped a limiter that does not limit:
 *
 *   1. **The store was per-process and in-memory.** The deploy runs an `api` and
 *      an `api-standby` container behind nginx (docker-compose.yml,
 *      scripts/deploy.sh), so a `max: 10` limiter actually allowed 10 per
 *      container. Redis-backed here, via the `rate-limit-redis` dependency that
 *      was already declared and never wired.
 *   2. **`trust proxy` was `true`.** Express then believes the LEFTMOST
 *      X-Forwarded-For entry it can reach, which the client controls — so an
 *      attacker rotated their own rate-limit key by sending a different header
 *      on each request. `server.js` now sets a hop count (TRUST_PROXY_HOPS,
 *      default 1 for the single nginx in front), which makes `req.ip` the
 *      address nginx actually saw.
 *
 * Redis is a soft dependency: if it is unavailable the limiter degrades to the
 * in-process store rather than failing the request. That is weaker, and it is
 * logged loudly at boot — an auth endpoint that 500s because the cache is down
 * is a worse outcome than one that is rate-limited per container.

 * scraper, or one tenant's integration retrying hard consumed the single
 * Postgres, the single Redis and the single host that every OTHER tenant is
 * served from. On a shared-nothing deployment that is one customer's problem;
 * here it is everyone's, and there was no signal until the box fell over.
 *
 * KEYED BY TENANT FIRST, then IP. Keying on IP alone is wrong in both
 * directions here: an office behind one NAT looks like a single abusive client,
 * while a distributed integration for one tenant looks like a thousand innocent
 * ones. The tenant slug is the unit of fairness, because the tenant is what the
 * capacity is shared between. IP is the fallback before the Host resolves and
 * for the platform surface.
 *
 * SET HIGH ON PURPOSE. This is a CIRCUIT BREAKER, not a quota — it exists to
 * stop one caller taking the estate down, not to shape normal traffic. A busy
 * screen fans out to a dozen calls, so a working day of heavy use must sit
 * comfortably underneath it. A ceiling that trips on legitimate use gets raised
 * in a panic during an incident, and then it is not a control any more.
 * Deliberately generous, and worth revisiting with real numbers once
 * `praxis_http_requests_total` has some history.
