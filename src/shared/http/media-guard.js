/**
 * Allow-list for the flat `/media` static mount (local storage driver).
 *
 * THE BUG THIS CLOSES. `storage.service` writes every artefact under one root
 * (STORAGE_LOCAL_PATH, default ./data/vault) namespaced per tenant, and
 * `server.js` mounted express.static over the whole of it. That is correct for
 * logos — they must load pre-auth, on the login screen, before any token exists
 * — but the SAME root holds `tenant_<slug>/vault/doc_*.ext`: contracts,
 * payslips, signed PDFs. So the auth-gated download route
 * (`GET /documents/:id/download`, requirePermission) could be bypassed entirely
 * by anyone who knew or guessed a vault key.
 *
 * THE RULE. A key looks like `tenant_<slug>/<segment>/…`. Only the segments
 * below are served flat; everything else 404s and must go through its module's
 * gated route. Deny-by-default: a new artefact type is private until someone
 * deliberately adds it here.
 *
 * NOTE ON avatars. Kept public because the client renders them as a plain <img>
 * from `app_user.avatar_ref`; gating them would need an auth'd blob fetch at
 * every render site. They are low-sensitivity and the filename carries 10 hex
 * chars of entropy, but this IS a judgement call, not a non-issue — revisit if
 * profile photos are ever considered personal data under a tenant's policy.
 *
 * S3 (2026-08-02). This is no longer local-only. `/media` is mounted under BOTH
 * drivers and applies the same allow-list; under s3 a permitted key is answered
 * with a 302 to a short-TTL presigned URL instead of a static file. That means
 * **the bucket can be fully private** — nothing depends on public-read, and the
 * rule lives in code rather than in a bucket policy someone has to remember to
 * apply per environment. `storage.publicUrl` correspondingly never mints a direct
 * object URL for a private key (see storage.service.js).
