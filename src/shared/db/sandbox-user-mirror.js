/**
 * Keep `sandbox.app_user` populated with the LIVE users, so TEST-mode writes can
 * satisfy their actor foreign keys.
 *
 * WHY (2026-08-02). Session 3 pinned identity to the LIVE schema (`req.identityDb`)
 * so the LIVE/TEST toggle stops logging people out. Business data still writes
 * through `req.tenantDb`, which points at SANDBOX in TEST mode — and 60+ tenant
 * columns are typed `REFERENCES app_user(user_id)` (issued_by, validated_by,
 * approved_by, received_by, counted_by, owner_user_id, …). Storing a perfectly
 * valid live user id beside sandbox business data therefore raises 23503, usually
 * AFTER the business row has committed, surfacing as "Referenced record not found"
 * on a record that then already exists.
 *
 * Session 17 fixed this for the wipe path only: `provisioning.wipeSandbox` copied
 * `live.app_user` across after rebuilding the schema. Two holes were left open:
 *
 *   1. **A newly provisioned tenant.** Provisioning creates both schemas and runs
 *      the seeds, and no seed creates an app_user row; the first admin is created
 *      afterwards, by `createAdmin` / `scripts/tenant/create-admin.js`, into LIVE
 *      only. So `sandbox.app_user` is empty and the tenant's first TEST write dies.
 *      Calling the mirror during provisioning cannot help — at that point there is
 *      no user to copy.
 *   2. **Drift on an established tenant.** The mirror was a point-in-time snapshot
 *      taken at wipe. Every user created afterwards — a new employee onboarded
 *      months later — was absent from sandbox and hit exactly the same 23503, on a
 *      tenant that had been working fine.
 *
 * Both close at the source: mirror whenever a user is created or changed, not only
 * when the sandbox is rebuilt. `scripts/tenant/mirror-users.js` backfills tenants
 * provisioned before this existed.
 *
 * NOT a security widening. These rows are FK targets, not credentials in play:
 * auth, sessions and RBAC all resolve against `req.identityDb` (live), so nothing
 * signs in "as" a sandbox row. `password_hash` comes along only because the column
 * is NOT NULL — it is never read from this schema. `totp_secret_enc` and
 * `godmode_pin_hash` are omitted for the same reason. `employee_id` is deliberately
 * not copied: it references `sandbox.employee`, which a wipe empties, so carrying
 * it would trade one 23503 for another.

 *
 * `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` carries no conflict target on purpose — it must absorb
 * a `user_id` clash (already mirrored) AND an `email` clash (a stale sandbox row
 * from an older seed with the same address under a different id). The single-user
 * path verifies afterwards and warns, since an email collision is the one case
 * where "no rows inserted" still leaves the FK unsatisfied.
 *
 * An already-mirrored row is then brought in step with live for the fields
 * sandbox reads as facts: `status` above all (a user suspended after the first
 * copy used to stay ACTIVE in sandbox forever), plus the name and 2FA flag.
 * `email` and `username` are left alone: they are unique, and a stale sandbox
