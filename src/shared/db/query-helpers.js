/**
 * Small SQL builders shared by module repos. Values are parameterised. No ORM.
 *
 * SEC H3 (High). This file's header used to assert "Table/column names are
 * always code-provided (never user input)". THAT WAS NOT TRUE, and the
 * assertion is why nobody looked.
 *
 * `insertOne`/`updateOne` build their column list from `Object.keys(data)`.
 * That is safe for a module with a zod validator, because `z.object` strips
 * unknown keys and the middleware reassigns `req.body = p.data`. It is not safe
 * for the ten modules on `passthrough`, which was a pair of no-op middlewares:
 * `makeController.create/update` handed `req.body` through untouched.
 *
 * Two defects followed. MASS ASSIGNMENT: any column of the target table could
 * be written, so a holder of MOD-67 `edit` could clear `killed_at` on a revoked
 * session — resurrecting an administrator session security staff believed they
 * had terminated — or repoint a session's `user_id`. IDENTIFIER INJECTION: the
 * keys were concatenated with no quoting or validation, so a key WAS a SQL
 * fragment, turning a tenant-admin grant into arbitrary SQL on the tenant
 * database under the shared application role.
 *
 * Three layers now, because either one alone leaves a gap:
 *
 *   1. every identifier is validated against a strict pattern and rejected if
 *      it does not match — this is what closes injection, and it cannot be
 *      forgotten by a module author because it lives here;
 *   2. every identifier is double-quoted, so even a valid-but-reserved word
 *      behaves;
 *   3. `makeRepo` may declare `writable`, an explicit allow-list, which closes
 *      mass assignment independently of injection.

 * Encode the jsonb columns of a patch before it is bound as query parameters.

 * WHY THIS HAS TO BE EXPLICIT. node-postgres serialises a JS object to JSON,
 * but a JS ARRAY becomes a POSTGRES ARRAY LITERAL — `{"a","b"}` — which is not
 * JSON. Bound to a jsonb column that raises 22P02, which the error handler
 * turns into `400 INVALID_VALUE`, "One of the values is in the wrong format":
 * no column named, no field named. It shipped twice, in
 * `service_type_web_profile.highlights_*` and `service_type_field.options_json`,
 * and in both cases it made a whole screen unsaveable while looking like a
 * mysterious rejection of the user's text.
 *
 * `insertOne`/`updateOne` cannot infer this: they do not know the schema, and
 * `uuid[]` columns need the raw array that jsonb must not get. So the caller,
 * which does know its own table, names the jsonb columns here.
 *
 * ALWAYS stringifies rather than guessing whether a string is already JSON.
 * The values arriving here are logical values off a validated request body —
 * the string "FCL" is the JSON document `"FCL"`, and passing it through raw is
 * a 22P02 of its own. `null`/`undefined` become SQL NULL; a NOT NULL column
 * whose empty state is `[]` or `{}` must substitute that before calling.

 * Run a list query that must return EVERY matching row, with a ceiling that

 * row the tenant had ever had.
 *
 * The obvious fix — apply the default limit of 50 — is wrong for several of
 * them, and dangerously so. `permission.listAll` EXISTS BECAUSE the paginated
 * version truncated: the grant matrix has more rows than the default seed
 * writes, so an editor loading through the paged endpoint could not see most
 * grants and overwrote them blind. Capping that endpoint would reintroduce
 * exactly the bug it was written to fix.
 *
 * So the rule here is: never silently truncate. Ask for `ceiling + 1` rows. If
 * that many come back, the caller's assumption that the set is small has been
 * violated, and the honest response is an error naming the endpoint — not a
 * prefix of the data presented as the whole. A loud 500 gets fixed; a silent
 * truncation on a permissions matrix corrupts the matrix.
 *
 * RETURNS `{ rows }`, deliberately — the same shape as `client.query`. Every
