/**
 * Resolve the DOWNWARD closure of a user's scope assignments: every scope they

 * tree — the organigramme.
 *
 * This is what approval routing needs and `getUserScopeIds` above does not give.
 * A workflow step names the scope the decision belongs to (e.g. the Douala
 * branch); an approver qualifies if they sit at that node **or at an ancestor of
 * it**, because authority flows downward — the regional manager over Douala can
 * approve Douala's work, not the reverse. Expressed from the user's side, that
 * is exactly "is the step's scope inside my closure".
 *
 * CACHED SINCE PERF S4, and the original reason for not caching is worth keeping
 * because it was right: this walks a tree whose shape changes when any scope is
 * re-parented, and a cache keyed by USER would leave every descendant user stale
 * for the TTL. The old comment concluded that approval decisions are rare, so
 * the round trip was cheap.
 *
 * That conclusion was wrong about WHERE this runs. `requirePermission` calls it
 * on EVERY permission-gated request, not just approvals — so a recursive CTE ran
 * on essentially every authenticated request in the product, against a
 * `parent_scope_id` column that had no index until migration 0500. The plan
 * showed `Seq Scan on scope … loops=4`: the whole table re-scanned once per
 * recursion level. Measured at 19,510 nodes: 14.78 ms per request, falling to
 * 0.92 ms with the index alone.
 *
 * The fix for the staleness objection is to invalidate on the TREE rather than
 * the USER. A monotonic version counter is folded into the cache key, and any
 * write to `scope` or `user_scope` bumps it — which makes every cached closure
 * in the tenant unreachable at once, in a single INCR, with no scan and no
 * window in which a stale closure can be read. Re-parenting is rare; requests
 * are not. That asymmetry is what makes this safe to cache when a per-user
 * invalidation would not have been.
 *
 * `depth < 32` caps the walk. `UNION` (not UNION ALL) already terminates on a
 * cycle by discarding rows it has seen, but the cap is kept as a second brake:
 * scope has no cycle guard yet (scope.validator.js is passthrough — audit
 * finding A4), so a malformed tree must not be able to spin a request.
