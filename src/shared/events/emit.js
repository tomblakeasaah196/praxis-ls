/**
 * Event + audit helpers for module services. Runs on the tenant connection.
 *   emitEvent  → live.event_log (drives notifications, workflows, compliance)
 *   audit      → live.immutable_ledger (append-only trail; 10-year retention)
 * Both are best-effort-safe: a logging failure must not break the business op,
 * EXCEPT audit of security-critical actions which should bubble up.
 *
 * Watch-the-Watcher (PRD §5.7, WORK_TO_BE_DONE.md Phase 0) is implemented
 * *here*, centrally, so every security-critical event is caught no matter which
 * module emits it — rather than wiring a notifier into each of the three
 * (permission/role/field_visibility) services separately and missing the next
 * one someone adds. The `event_type.is_security_critical` flag (seeded in
 * 9020_seed_rbac_events.sql) is the single source of truth:
 *   - the event_log row's priority is forced to HIGH for those events, and
 *   - a HIGH IN_APP notification is fanned out to every active CEO / MANAGEMENT
 *     user (the "watchers").
 * Both run in the caller's transaction, so the notification is atomic with the
 * change that triggered it. The fan-out is a single INSERT…SELECT guarded by an
 * EXISTS on is_security_critical, so it is a no-op (zero rows) for the ~99% of
 * events that are NORMAL — no branching round-trip in JS.

 *
 *   - the user's row lives in `live.app_user` (auth, RBAC, sessions),

 *     that `sandbox.app_user` has never heard of → 23503.
 *
 * That surfaced as "Referenced record not found" on the FIRST create in a freshly
 * wiped sandbox (no `90*` seed creates users), AFTER the business row had already
 * committed — so the record existed but the request 409'd, and a retry then hit a
 * duplicate-key error. It affected every module on the shared CRUD kit, not one.
 *
 * `WHERE EXISTS` degrades that to a NULL actor: the audit row is still written —
 * which matters, because the ledger's job is to record that the action happened —
 * and the attribution is simply absent where it cannot be validated. Losing an
 * actor id on a sandbox row is a far smaller harm than losing the row, or than
