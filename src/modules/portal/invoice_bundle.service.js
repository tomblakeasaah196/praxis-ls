/**
 * An invoice's supporting documents, shared with the client (client portal
 * redesign PR 2, migration 14160).
 *
 * THE FLOW, as the owner asked for it: at the end of a file the final invoice
 * goes to the client with the proof behind its disbursements. Finance opens
 * the invoice, sees every document the file's reconciliation holds — the ones
 * a cash request marked as owing a receipt already ticked — unticks anything
 * internal, and publishes. ONE click. The client's portal then shows the
 * invoice with its documents, and "download all" returns the invoice and every
 * document as one ZIP, numbered in the order the lines appear.
 *
 * WHAT PUBLISHING DOES NOT DO: it does not touch the vault rows. A receipt is
 * evidence first; the bundle is a grant for one invoice, and withdrawing it
 * takes nothing out of the file.
