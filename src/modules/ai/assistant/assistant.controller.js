/**
 * SSE streaming ask — the answer renders word-by-word in the client instead of
 * waiting 5–15 seconds for the full completion. This is the single biggest UX
 * improvement: first-token latency drops from seconds to ~500ms.
 *
 * Protocol: `text/event-stream`, one `data: {json}\n\n` per event. Event types:
 *   delta, status, reset, answer, actions, sources, trace, done, error.
 * `status` and `reset` carry the assistant's working-out rather than its reply:
 * status is an ephemeral "what I am doing now" line, and reset tells the client
 * that what it has rendered so far was narration and should be taken back.
 * The client's `askPraxisStream` in `ai-api.ts` consumes this and updates the
 * thread incrementally.
 *
 * WHY SSE AND NOT WEBSOCKETS. The existing realtime layer uses Socket.IO for
 * push notifications, but streaming an answer is a request-response pattern —
 * the client asks, the server answers. SSE is simpler (no upgrade, no bidi),
 * works over HTTP/2, and auto-reconnects in browsers. Socket.IO would mean
 * multiplexing chat over the same socket as notifications, which is a coupling
 * the product does not need.
 *
 * WHY `req.tenantDb` WRAPS THE WHOLE GENERATOR. Each event needs the tenant
 * client for reads/writes during tool execution. Rather than acquiring/releasing
 * per event (which would drop the connection between events), we hold it for the
 * full stream and release when the generator completes or the client disconnects.
