/**
 * Shared Shipment/Service Detail Component — the service layer.
 *
 * TWO JOBS, and they are the whole point of the module:
 *
 *   1. `applyValues` — the WRITE side. A dossier arrives carrying a bag of
 *      service-specific values keyed by field key. This splits them into the
 *      dossier columns some of them are bound to and the `details_json` the
 *      rest live in, validates every one against its definition, and refuses
 *      the ones that are not defined for this service type. Nothing else in the
 *      codebase is allowed to write `details_json` for a dossier, so there is
 *      exactly one place where "is this a legal value for this field" is
 *      decided.
 *
 *   2. `forDossier` — the READ side. The canonical projection every consumer
 *      binds to: facets (what this file's transport reference / route / cargo
 *      IS, whatever the service type), the rendered groups, the equipment, and
 *      a completeness figure. One shape, twelve service types, and any number
 *      of service types nobody has invented yet.
 *
 * WHY THE WRITE PATH IS STRICT AND THE READ PATH IS FORGIVING. A value that is
 * not defined for the service type is a bug in the caller and is rejected with
 * the field named. But a dossier whose service type has NO field set, or whose
 * set was retired, still reads: `forDossier` degrades to the core columns and
 * an empty facet map rather than throwing. Files must not become unreadable
 * because somebody archived a form.

 * The formats a field definition may require, BY NAME.

 * WHY NOT A REGEX ON THE DEFINITION. The first version let a field carry its own
 * `pattern` string and did `new RegExp(pattern).test(value)`. That is regular
 * expression injection (CodeQL js/regex-injection, and it flagged it): the
 * pattern is authored by a tenant admin through the API, so a catastrophically
 * backtracking one — `(a+)+$` against a long value — would hang the save path
 * for everybody on that tenant. Node has no way to time a regex out.
 *
 * It also was not a feature anyone asked for. A named list is what an admin
 * actually wants ("this field is an email"), it cannot be weaponised, every
 * expression is owned and reviewed here, and adding a format is a one-line
 * change with a test rather than a support call.
 *
 * Each is anchored and linear — no nested quantifiers, nothing that can
 * backtrack super-linearly.

 *
 * Before this, `pol` was a text column and the picker allowed free text, so
 * "Doula" (one letter short of Cameroon's main port) saved cleanly. What happened
 * next is the part that matters: `resolvePlaces` forward-geocoded it in the
 * background, Geoapify answered with something plausible, and the dossier was
 * silently linked to a coordinate nobody had looked at. No error, no flag, and a
 * lane on the meeting-room map that was simply in the wrong place. A geocoder
 * asked to resolve a typo does not fail — it guesses, confidently.
 *
 * ── WHY IT IS A LOCAL LOOKUP AND NOT A GEOCODE ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * Verified means "a human has already put this place in the catalogue" — either
 * it shipped in the reference data, or somebody confirmed a provider suggestion,
 * or somebody entered it by hand. That is one indexed query. Reaching the
 * network here would make opening a file depend on a third party being up, and
 * "your file could not be opened because a geocoder was slow" is not a sentence
 * this product is going to say.
 *
 * ── WHY ONLY AT CREATE/PROMOTE ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `enforceRequired` is true exactly when a file is being OPENED. Later edits are
 * not gated, which is deliberate and matches how `is_required` already behaves
 * here: an operator correcting an ETA on a legacy file must not be blocked
 * because a place typed in 2024 is not in the catalogue. Those files surface in
 * the location-needed queue and carry an upgrade action instead — visible and
 * fixable, rather than an error in the way of unrelated work.
 *
 * The message names the field and says what to do, because the one thing this
 * must not become is a wall the operator cannot get past: every branch of the
 * picker (catalogue, worldwide search, nearby reference point, manual entry)
 * produces a value that satisfies this check.

/**
 * Freeze a file's shipment details onto a document that is locking (0661).

 * WHY. `forDossier` is computed live, which is right for every screen asking
 * "what do we know now" and wrong for a document that has been approved,
 * issued or posted. A costing approved citing MSC ARUSHI must still cite MSC
 * ARUSHI after the carrier rolls the booking — otherwise an approved record
 * silently rewrites itself, which under OHADA it may not.
 *
 * BEST-EFFORT, AND DELIBERATELY SO. Called from inside a lock transition. A
 * document that FAILED TO BE APPROVED because its details could not be
 * snapshotted would be a worse outcome than one whose snapshot is NULL — and
 * NULL is already a supported state (every pre-0661 document has one, and the
 * readers fall back to the live projection). So this never throws.
 *
 * `table` is code-provided, never request-provided: it is validated against the
 * five documents 0661 actually added the column to, so it can never become an
 * identifier from a payload.

/**
 * The five documents 0661 added the column to, each as a COMPLETE statement
 * rather than a table name to interpolate.
 *
 * Written this way on purpose. A `UPDATE ${table} SET … WHERE ${pk} = $1` is
 * safe here — `table` is code-provided and checked against this map — but it is
 * the same construction `query-helpers` exists to keep out of module code, and
 * it reads as a SQL-injection sink to a human reviewer and a static analyser
 * alike. A lookup of finished statements cannot be got wrong by a later caller,
 * and needs no argument about whether the input is trusted.
 *
 * `AND shipment_details_snapshot IS NULL` makes every one idempotent: a
 * document that has already been frozen is never re-frozen, so a retried
 * transition cannot overwrite what the document said when it first locked.
