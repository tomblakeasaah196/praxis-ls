 * dossier in five, and no screen ever wired `POST /milestones/instantiate` at
 * all. The result was dossiers with no chain, an empty 360° Milestones tab, and
 * a Control Tower with nothing to show progress from. A step that reliably
 * doesn't happen shouldn't be a step — the dossier is the centre of gravity and
 * milestones are its spine.
 *
 * BEST-EFFORT, AND DELIBERATELY SO. Called AFTER the dossier's transaction has
 * committed, in its own, and every failure is swallowed with a warning:
 *
 *   - no service_type_id on the dossier        → nothing to template from
 *   - no active template for that service type → instantiate throws 422
 *   - anything else                            → logged, not raised
 *
 * A dossier that exists without milestones is a normal, recoverable state (add
 * the template, instantiate later). A dossier that FAILED TO BE CREATED because
 * its milestones couldn't be seeded is not. Never let the tail wag the dog.

 *
 * Only fills a GAP: a dossier that already carries an id (the user picked from
 * the list) is left alone, and so is one with no port text to resolve.
 *
 * BEST-EFFORT, and outside any transaction — resolveMany may call Geoapify over
 * HTTP on a cache miss, and geoapify.service explicitly requires callers not to
 * hold a DB transaction across that wait. A failure leaves the dossier exactly
