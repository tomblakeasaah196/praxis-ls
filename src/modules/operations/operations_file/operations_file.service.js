/**
 * Seed the dossier's milestone chain from its service type's active template.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS AUTOMATIC (2026-08-01). Instantiating milestones was a separate
 * manual call that, in practice, nobody made: the sandbox seed did it for one
 * dossier in five, and no screen ever wired `POST /milestones/instantiate` at
 * all. The result was dossiers with no chain, an empty 360° Milestones tab, and
 * a Control Tower with nothing to show progress from. A step that reliably
 * doesn't happen shouldn't be a step — the dossier is the centre of gravity and
 * milestones are its spine.
 *
 * BEST-EFFORT, AND DELIBERATELY SO. Called AFTER the dossier's transaction has
 * committed, in its own, and every failure is swallowed with a warning:
 *
 *   - no service_type_id on the dossier        → nothing to template from
 *   - no active template for that service type → instantiate throws 422
 *   - anything else                            → logged, not raised
 *
 * A dossier that exists without milestones is a normal, recoverable state (add
 * the template, instantiate later). A dossier that FAILED TO BE CREATED because
 * its milestones couldn't be seeded is not. Never let the tail wag the dog.
 */
/**

 * service type has no template, or the template is malformed, or 0673's column is
 * missing on this tenant. The itinerary is editable afterwards from the file, so
 * a failure here costs a default, not the work.
 *
 * The legs go through `itinerary.replace`, which validates them — so a template
 * naming a place that is not in the catalogue is refused rather than seeding a
 * route nobody can plot. `legsFromTemplate` only ever puts the file's own
 * (already verified) POL/POD on the main carriage, so the normal path is clean.
