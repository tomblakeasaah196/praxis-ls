/**
 * Anonymous public read of the tenant website — `/public/services` (guide
 * §3.2, §4.5). Pinned to the LIVE schema (`req.tenantDbIn("live", …)`) so an
 * internet caller never selects sandbox via `X-Praxis-Env`. Rate-limited at
 * 120/15min per `makeLimiter` — same shape as `portfolio_public`.
 *
 * The loader discovers this module by walking `src/modules/<group>/<module>/
 * <module>.routes.js` and mounts it on the tenant router gated by
 * `feature: "website"`. `requireFeature` only needs tenant context, so the
 * anonymous router can carry the flag and answer `FEATURE_DISABLED` (403)
 * when the package is off.
 *
 * The `/media/:id` route streams the image bytes itself; nothing about the
 * streaming depends on a tenant connection that the public surface can reach,
 * and the allowlist re-check (`repo.publicMediaForServe`) is what makes a
 * doc id genuinely servable. That function:
 *   - refuses a non-UUID id at the boundary (no DB hit);
 *   - re-verifies VERIFIED + scope + image content type;
 *   - joins the owning `service_type_web_profile` AND the master
 *     `service_type` so it can assert `p.is_published = true AND
 *     st.is_active = true` (an embargoed launch preview, an archived
 *     service, or a draft edit all stop the stream); and
 *   - binds the doc to the specific slot — `cover_vault_id`,
 *     `icon_vault_id`, or one of the `gallery_vault_ids` — so a doc
 *     scoped to service A cannot be served from a request for
 *     service B's media, and a doc archived out of the cover slot is
 *     not served as a cover from a stale URL.
 * Mirrors the named precedent at `portfolio_public.service.js:117-139`.
