/**
 * AI manifest for the milestone engine.
 *
 * The reads are the interesting half: "which files are forecast to breach", and
 * "who is costing us time" are questions the assistant can now answer from the
 * chain itself, because the engine records variance and attribution rather than
 * just a status.
 *
 * `reopen` is deliberately NOT exposed as a write. Un-completing a milestone
 * rewrites the anchor every downstream date is measured from and voids the
 * variance already recorded against it; that needs a human who can state a
 * reason, not an assistant acting on an inferred one.
