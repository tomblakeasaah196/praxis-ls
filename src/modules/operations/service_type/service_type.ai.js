/**
 * AI manifest for the service taxonomy.
 *
 * READ-ONLY on purpose. Service types are configuration that everything else
 * classifies against — milestone templates hang off them,
 * `dictionary_item.service_type_key` references them, and they drive the Control
 * Tower's transport mode. `key` is immutable after creation precisely because a
 * rename orphans those references, so this is not a surface the assistant should
 * be proposing changes to on a user's behalf. Reads let it answer "which
 * services do we sell, which are missing a milestone template, and what is
 * classified under a given one".
 *
 * The screen is `master/service-types` — the taxonomy lives in the Master Data
 * hub in the UI; the backend module stays under `operations` because it rides
 * MOD-29 with the dossier (see service_type.events.js for why).
