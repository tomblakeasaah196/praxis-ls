/**
 * Transit order (MOD-30) — pure lifecycle and pure arithmetic. No SQL, no HTTP.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL. The legacy transit order had no lifecycle: the
 * PHP endpoint INSERTed a row and the operator hit Print. Nothing recorded
 * whether the client ever signed the thing, which matters because the signature
 * is the authorisation — a declaration lodged against an unsigned order is one
 * we cannot defend if the declared value is later disputed. So the states below
 * are not decoration; SIGNED is a gate, and `assertCanLodge` is the reason.
 *
 * Everything here is a pure function so it can be tested without a database,
 * and so the service reads as a sequence of decisions rather than a wall of
 * conditionals. Same split as quotation.rules.js.
