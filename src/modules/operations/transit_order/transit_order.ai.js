/**
 * MOD-30 tool catalogue for the function-calling assistant.
 *
 * ISSUE AND LODGE ARE EXPOSED; SIGN AND CANCEL ARE NOT — deliberately.
 *
 * `sign` asserts that a client physically stamped a piece of paper, on the
 * strength of a scan the assistant cannot see. `cancel` withdraws a numbered
 * customs instrument. Neither is a statement a language model should be able to
 * make on a user's behalf, however well it confirms first. Both stay
 * human-only, at the UI.
 *
 * Everything exposed is `confirm: true` and permission-gated on the same action
 * the HTTP route requires, so the gate cannot drift between the two surfaces.
