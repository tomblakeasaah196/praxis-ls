    // an AI action carries ONE flat `required_permission` and no capability

    // useless for the ordinary correction it exists for, or overriding rides
    // in on `edit` and the gate is worth nothing.

    // to is a human's call, made by a named person who answers for it. The
    // refusal is explicit so the model says so plainly instead of retrying.
