/**
 * The public signing page (MOD-64) — doc/SIGNATURE_ENGINEERING_GUIDE.md §6.6.
 *
 * A counterparty on a phone, with no account, holding a link. This is what
 * answers them.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * THE FOUR RULES THIS FILE EXISTS TO KEEP
 *
 * 1. NOTHING HERE READS AN ADDRESS FROM THE BODY. Q7 = C is forbidden
 *    (§6.3): there is no path where a signer supplies the address their own
 *    OTP goes to. `resolve()` returns the address MASKED and the validator
 *    has no `email` field at all — so a caller sending one is rejected, not
 *    ignored. What a signer MAY state is their name and role, which is
 *    `identity_source = 'DECLARED'`, and the portal and certificate both say
 *    the name is CLAIMED while the email is PROVED (§1.3(d)).
 *
 * 2. EVERY COMPLETION PASSES THROUGH VERIFICATION (Q1, §1.5(b)). STAMP and
 *    DRAWN both require a verified OTP before `/complete` will accept, with no
 *    threshold and no setting that disables it. The database says so too —
 *    `ck_sig_external_verified` in 10771 — so a future endpoint cannot get it
 *    wrong either.
 *
 * 3. `/complete` RE-DERIVES THE CANONICAL HASH (§1.3(a)). Mismatch → 409
 *    DOCUMENT_AMENDED, the request moves to AMENDED, every signed party is
 *    notified, a compliance flag is raised. This is what stops party B signing
 *    something party A never saw.
 *
 * 4. THE MENU IS RESOLVED SERVER-SIDE ON EVERY RENDER (§3.4). A menu resolved
 *    once at dispatch and trusted thereafter would keep offering a card after
 *    the tenant turned it off.
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
