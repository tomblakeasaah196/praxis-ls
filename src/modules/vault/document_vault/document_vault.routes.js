/**
 * SEC-M3 — authority follows the RECORD, not the screen.
 *
 * `GET /:id` and `/:id/download` required MOD-64 `view` and nothing else. The
 * vault holds contracts, payslips, ID documents and signed PDFs across HR,
 * finance and operations, so anyone granted MOD-64 for any legitimate reason —
 * an operations clerk who needs to read shipping paperwork — could enumerate
 * and download **every document in the tenant, including HR files about their
 * colleagues**. The `field_visibility` layer masks FIELDS and has no document
 * analogue; the `/media` mount is correctly gated (`shared/http/media-guard.js`)
 * and the gap was always the granularity behind it, not the mount.
 *
 * This is the same principle `document-templates` already implements via
 * `moduleKeyForDocType` (template.routes.js) and `approval_task.module_key`
 * (0488): a payslip needs the payroll grant, a purchase request needs MOD-62.
 *
 * THE DIFFERENCE, and why this could not simply reuse that middleware: there
 * the doc type is in the URL, so the module is known before any I/O. Here it is
 * a column on the row, so the record must be loaded FIRST and the grant checked
 * against what it turns out to be. That ordering is the whole implementation.
 *
 * MOD-64 still passes, deliberately. It is the vault administrator's grant, and
 * revoking that in the same change would break the people whose job is the
 * vault itself — a silent lockout dressed as a security fix. The tightening
 * that matters is that MOD-64 is no longer the ONLY way in, and no longer a
 * skeleton key for departments a holder has no grant on.
