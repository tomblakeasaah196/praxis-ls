/**
 * The vault's own authorisation rule — C-2.
 *
 * SEC-M3 put this rule in `requireDocumentPermission`, an express middleware in
 * `document_vault.routes.js` keyed on `req.params.id`. That made it correct for
 * the vault's own two routes and UNREACHABLE from anywhere else: a caller in
 * another module could only reach `service.get`, which is a bare id lookup, so
 * the rule may as well not have existed for them.
 *
 * `mail/attachment.service.fromVault` was that caller. It called
 * `documentVault.get(client, id, { actor })` — passing an actor the function
 * does not take — under a comment stating that "`getByRef`/`get` apply the
 * module's own confidentiality rules", which was simply not true. Any MOD-72
 * *create* user could attach ANY document in the tenant vault — HR files, other
 * clients' contracts, bank documents — to a draft and mail it outside. The
 * comment is the interesting part of that finding: the author checked that the
 * rule should be applied and believed it was.
 *
 * So the decision moves here, where any module can call it, and the middleware
 * becomes a thin wrapper over it. One rule, two callers — the same shape as
 * `mail/triage/visibility.js`.
 *
 * TWO CLIENTS, deliberately. The document row lives in the tenant schema
 * (which may be sandbox) and the RBAC grants live in the identity/live schema.
 * Callers that have one connection for both — mail is pinned to live by
 * `req.identityDb` — pass it twice; the vault's own routes pass `req.tenantDb`
 * and `req.identityDb` respectively. Guessing one from the other here is how a
 * sandbox caller would end up checked against no grants at all.
 *
 * Returns the document row on success. Throws PERMISSION_DENIED (403) when the
 * caller may not read it, and returns null when it does not exist — existence
 * is the CALLER's to report, so this does not turn a missing id into a
 * permission error or vice versa.
