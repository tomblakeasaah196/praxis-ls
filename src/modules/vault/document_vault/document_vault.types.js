 *
 * Why it was needed: the document viewer (`DocumentPage`, the View button on
 * every finance / procurement / HR / fleet / WMS / operations record) renders
 * through `POST /document-templates/:docType/preview`, and that router is gated
 * on **MOD-70 (Settings)** because it began life as the template Studio — an
 * admin configuration screen. So opening your own purchase request required the
 * Settings permission, and every non-admin got "You don't have permission to do
 * this" on a document they had just created.
 *
 * Reading a document now follows the module that owns the record; only the
 * template CONFIG routes stay on MOD-70, which is what that grant is actually
 * for. Same reasoning as approval_task.module_key (0488).
 *
 * `module` (the path) stays as-is — it documents the issuer and is used to keep
 * the template keys joined to the registry.
