/**
 * The public verification portal (MOD-66) —
 * doc/SIGNATURE_ENGINEERING_GUIDE.md §5.4, §5.5.
 *
 * A stranger holding a piece of paper scans the QR printed on it, or types the
 * twelve characters underneath. This is what answers them.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * THE FOUR RULES THIS FILE EXISTS TO KEEP
 *
 * 1. THE SUMMARY IS THE DOCUMENT AS SIGNED, NEVER A LIVE QUERY. (Q12 = B,
 *    §1.5(d)). It renders from `document_signature.content_payload` — the
 *    canonical struct frozen at signing time. A live query would let an OLD
 *    copy disclose the CURRENT state: someone holding a March waybill scans it
 *    in September and reads today's line items, today's counterparty, today's
 *    amendments. Facts that were never on their paper.
 *
 *    The ONLY live computation on this page is the hash comparison that
 *    produces the two verdicts.
 *
 * 2. UNKNOWN IS ONE ANSWER. A malformed code and a code that never existed
 *    return the SAME 404 with the SAME body. Distinguishing them turns the
 *    portal into an oracle that confirms which codes are real, and the code
 *    space is 2^60 — small enough that an oracle plus time is a working attack.
 *
 * 3. THE PUBLIC READ IS PINNED TO LIVE. The routes layer does this
 *    (`req.tenantDbIn("live", …)`), and it is stated here too because it is the
 *    kind of thing a later refactor "simplifies" back to `req.tenantDb`.
 *
 * 4. NOTHING HERE PRINTS A FULL IP. §3.13 — masked through
 *    services/signatures/mask.js, which is the only formatter allowed to.
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * ── What replaced what ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * This module used to resolve a doc by `doc_id` or `entity_ref` plus a hash
 * FRAGMENT, and match it with `stored.startsWith(hash)` against a validator
 * whose floor was FOUR characters. Sixteen bits of hex, against a public
 * endpoint with no rate limiter: verification succeeded on a prefix an attacker
 * could enumerate in seconds, and — worse — the caller supplied the identifier
 * of the document they wanted checked, so a "verified" verdict proved nothing
 * about the paper in their hand.
 *
 * There is now no prefix path, no `min(4)`, and no caller-supplied target: one
 * exact lookup on a unique-indexed credential that only the printed document
 * carries.
