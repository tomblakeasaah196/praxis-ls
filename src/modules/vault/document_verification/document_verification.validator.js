/**
 * The portal takes ONE input: the code printed on the document.
 *
 * What is gone from here matters more than what is left. This validator used
 * to accept `{ doc_id?, entity_ref?, hash }` with `hash: z.string().min(4)`,
 * and the service matched it with `stored.startsWith(hash)`. Four hex
 * characters is sixteen bits, on a public endpoint with no limiter — and
 * because the CALLER supplied the document to check, a "verified" answer said
 * nothing about the paper in their hand. There is no target parameter now: the
 * code identifies the signature, and only the printed document carries it.
 *
 * The shape check is deliberately loose (length and alphabet, in
 * services/signatures/tokens.js) and the service turns every failure into the
 * same 404 the never-existed case returns. A 422 here would tell a caller their
 * guess was WELL-FORMED but wrong, which is an oracle: the code space is 2^60,
 * and an oracle plus time is a working attack (§3.7).
