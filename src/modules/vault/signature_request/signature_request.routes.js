/**
 * Signature requests (MOD-64). Gated; feature 'signatures.external'.
 *
 * RBAC maps onto the tenant's fixed five-action vocabulary (0110_rbac.sql):
 *   view   — see requests and their chains
 *   create — create a request and dispatch it
 *   edit   — add the ONE manually-entered signatory (§6.3)
 *   delete — void a request
 *
 * `create` and `approve` stay separate for the reason document_signature.routes
 * already records: drafting a document for signature and attesting to it are
 * different authorities. Putting your own name on a document takes `approve`
 * and lives on /signatures; ASKING somebody else to takes `create` and lives
 * here.
 *
 * The whole module is behind `signatures.external` rather than `signatures`,
 * so a tenant that has the portal (PR-2) but has not been switched on for
 * external signing gets a clean 403 rather than a half-working chain.
