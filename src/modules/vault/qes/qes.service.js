/**
 * QES envelopes (MOD-64) — Tier 3, the certified signature.
 * doc/SIGNATURE_ENGINEERING_GUIDE.md §7.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * THE FOUR RULES A REVIEWER SHOULD REJECT A PR OVER
 *
 * 1. CHARGE ON ISSUE, AND ONLY ON ISSUE (§7.4 step 3). The ledger row is
 *    written in the same transaction as the envelope's provider_ref, and
 *    `provider_ref NOT NULL` on the ledger makes "charged without an
 *    envelope" unrepresentable. A provider 5xx leaves the envelope FAILED
 *    and ZERO ledger rows (§7.6 criterion 2) — nothing to delete, because
 *    nothing was ever written.
 *
 * 2. THE WEBHOOK IS VERIFIED BEFORE IT IS TRUSTED (§7.4 step 5). The
 *    signature check runs on the raw body before any field of it is read,
 *    and a failure rejects with nothing from the body in the log (§7.6
 *    criterion 4). The verification is the provider's documented HMAC over
 *    the event type and time (see signwell.adapter.verifyWebhook).
 *
 * 3. A REPLAYED WEBHOOK WRITES ONE SIGNATURE, NOT TWO (§7.6 criterion 5).
 *    The claim is a guarded envelope transition (CREATING/SENT → COMPLETED,
 *    in the shape transitionRequest and settleParty already use), and the
 *    party settlement is guarded the same way. A second delivery — from the
 *    provider's retries, the poll backstop, or both — sees the claim taken
 *    and returns without touching anything.
 *
 * 4. THE SIGNATURE IS WRITTEN AT THE SAME STANDARD AS THE OTHERS. A QES
 *    completion re-derives the canonical hash and compares it to the
 *    request's snapshot (§1.3(a)): if the document moved after the provider
 *    was sent, the request goes AMENDED, the envelope fails, and no
 *    signature is written — a certified signature whose document no longer
 *    matches is not a signature, it is a finding.
