/**
 * API F-15. `PUT /api/tenant/permissions/grant` writes the RBAC grant matrix —
 * the table that decides who can do what — and had no validator at all.
 *
 * It is not injectable: the repo is SQL-parameterised and coerces the five
 * permission flags with `!!`. The problem is different, and worse in its own
 * way. `role_id` and `module_key` were unchecked, so a non-UUID `role_id`
 * reached Postgres, raised `22P02`, and came back as `400 INVALID_VALUE` — a
 * FOURTH validation-error shape (F-2), arrived at through the database rather
 * than the validator, with no `fields` naming the bad value.
 *
 * The `!!` coercion is its own hazard: `{"can_delete": "false"}` is a truthy
 * string, so a client that sends booleans as strings grants delete when it
 * meant to revoke it. `z.boolean()` rejects that outright instead of quietly
 * turning it into `true`.
