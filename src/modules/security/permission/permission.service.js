 * point: writes emit `permission.changed` (seeded security-critical), which
 * shared/events/emit.js fans out as a HIGH notification to CEO/Management.
 *
 * Self-grant maker-checker (DB_ARCHITECTURE §108 — "a Super Admin cannot
 * self-grant Issuer/Validator/Approver") is enforced where authority is actually
 * assignable: capability.service.setForUser blocks a user adding a restricted
 * capability to themselves. It lives there, not here, because the documented rule
 * is about the ISSUER/VALIDATOR/APPROVER authority overlay, not this role×module
 * grant matrix. The identity tables are pinned to the live schema, so the block is
 * unconditional — that pinning is what the old "needs req.env" note predated.

/**
 * What the navigation shell may render for the CALLER.
 *
 * WHY THE SHELL NEEDS AN ENDPOINT AT ALL. Until now the client knew nothing
 * about permissions — `/auth/me` returns a name, a role label and two feature
 * flags — so every user saw every destination and found out what they could not
 * do by clicking it and getting a 403. A ribbon whose tabs differ per role
 * cannot be built on that.
 *
 * SHAPE. `{ modules, groups, byGroup, isCeo, version }`:
 *   modules  the MOD-xx keys this caller can read
 *   groups   the six workflow verbs those keys fall into, in catalogue order —
 *            resolved here rather than in the browser so the taxonomy has one
 *            definition (platform.module_catalogue.group_key) and the client
 *            has no second mapping to drift from it
 *   byGroup  the same partition, spelled out: verb → its visible module keys
 *   isCeo    the CEO bypass rbac.js already applies, surfaced so the shell
 *            agrees with the enforcement path instead of showing a CEO an empty
 *            ribbon
 *   version  a short digest of the resolved set
 *
 * WHY `byGroup` AND NOT JUST `groups`. `groups` says which tabs exist; it does
 * not say what belongs under one. The ribbon's second row has to place a
 * destination under a verb, and the only two ways to do that are to ship the
 * membership with the response or to write the taxonomy a second time in the
 * browser. The second is the thing this endpoint exists to prevent — a client
 * map would be a copy of `module_catalogue.group_key` that nothing keeps honest,
 * and it would go stale silently the first time a module is regrouped. So the
 * partition travels with the answer. The client still owns which ICON and which
 * ROUTE a key gets, because those are drawings and URLs, not taxonomy.
 *
 * WHAT `version` IS FOR. The client renders its LAST KNOWN ribbon immediately
 * from cache and revalidates in the background, so switching pages never
 * flashes an empty header. Comparing versions is how it learns the cache is
 * stale — and, because the digest covers the exact key set AND the verb each
 * key sits under, a REVOCATION is distinguishable from a GRANT by comparing the
 * sets themselves. That distinction is the point: losing access has to take
 * effect at once, whereas forcing a reload to tell someone they have gained a
 * module would throw away whatever they were typing to deliver news that cannot
 * expose anything.

   * whose effect is most visible on screen.
