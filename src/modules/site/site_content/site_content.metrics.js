/**
 * The metric registry — what a stat block is allowed to ask the ERP for.
 *
 * This is the point of the whole website project. SmartLS's home page hardcodes
 * `data-counter="41850"` for cubic metres managed; it was true on the day
 * somebody typed it. We hold the dossiers that produce that number, so ours can
 * be true this morning. That is a thing no web agency can sell them.
 *
 * ── WHY A REGISTRY AND NOT A QUERY ON THE BLOCK ────────────────────────────
 * The tempting shape is to let the stat block carry its own SQL, or a table and
 * column, or a filter expression. Every version of that is arbitrary execution
 * driven by tenant-editable content, which is not a thing to be escaped or
 * sandboxed into safety — it is a thing not to build.
 *
 * So a block stores a KEY. The key names a metric implemented here, in code,
 * reviewed like code. Anything not on this list resolves to null and the block
 * falls back to its literal value. Adding a metric is a pull request, which is
 * exactly the friction wanted: a number that appears on a client's public
 * website should have had somebody look at how it is computed.
 *
 * ── THE CONTRACT ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Each metric is `{ key, unit, resolve(client) => number|null }`. `resolve`
 * takes the LIVE tenant client the caller already has and returns a plain
 * number. It must be cheap: this runs on a public page render, so anything that
 * cannot be a single indexed aggregate belongs in a nightly rollup that this
 * then reads, not here.
 *
 * A resolver that throws must not take the page down with it. `resolveMetric`
 * catches and returns null, and the renderer falls back to the literal — a
 * stale number on the page beats a 500 on a client's website.

 * Settled 2026-08-30. Each states its window and its filter, because a number
 * on a client's public website will eventually be questioned and the answer
 * must be in the code rather than in somebody's memory.
 *
 * ALL of these read `dossier_visible`, never `dossier`. The view is
 * `dossier WHERE status <> 'DRAFT'` and its own comment is explicit: read from
 * here for "lists, counts, dashboards, the portal and anything that
 * enumerates". A half-finished wizard state is not a file and must never reach
 * a marketing statistic.
 *
 * All are ALL-TIME and filtered to COMPLETED. Two reasons. A counter that can
 * go DOWN between two visits reads as an error to a visitor, and all-time
 * completed only ever rises. And "completed" is the only claim that is
 * unambiguously true — an open file is work in progress, not a delivered
 * result, and counting it would be advertising work not yet done.

   *
   * Files with a NULL volume contribute nothing rather than zero — SUM ignores
