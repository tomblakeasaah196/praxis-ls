 * Website settings — theme, social links, partners, credentials, the group
 * About and leadership.
 *
 * MODULE KEY: MOD-29, the same key `site_content` and `service_type_web` ride,
 * and for the reason stated there: all administration of the tenant's public
 * face sits behind one permission rather than six. Splitting it would mean an
 * administrator who can write the homepage but not set its colours, which is
 * not a distinction anyone has asked for.
 *
 * `feature: "website"` is the separate commercial switch and it gates only the
 * PUBLIC read. This module is reachable without it, so a tenant can prepare a
 * site before the package is on — the same split `site_content.routes.js`
 * documents.
