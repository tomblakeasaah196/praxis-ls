 * ISO country tables through a CommonJS interop boundary to do arithmetic a
 * server can do once and cache. Deriving here also means the settings preview
 * and the live site cannot disagree: both read this endpoint's output rather
 * than each running their own copy of the maths.
 *
 * The engine is imported by DEEP PATH (`@praxis/shared/design/palette`) rather

 * renderer — serve the original — so both answer `null` here rather than an
 * empty ladder a `<source>` would be emitted for.
 *
