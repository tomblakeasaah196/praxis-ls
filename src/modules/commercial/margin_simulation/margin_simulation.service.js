 * imported a mis-flagged charge had exactly two moves — submit it wrong, or
 * abandon it and build the whole thing again. REJECTED was therefore terminal
 * in practice, which defeats the point of having the state.
 *

 * REJECTED (costing-module.php:1665), and the simulator's `isLocked` is
 * explicitly false for a revision (margin-simulator-billing.php:1765).
 *
 * Editing a REJECTED simulation returns it to DRAFT and clears the rejection.
 * A rejection is an instruction to change something; once the author has, the
 * old verdict describes a document that no longer exists, and leaving it in
 * REJECTED would leave `submit` (DRAFT-only) unreachable — the same dead end in
