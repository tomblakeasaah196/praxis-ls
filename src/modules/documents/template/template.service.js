/**
 * Everything the composer needs to open on a document, in one round trip.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * ⚠  THIS REPLACES `window.prompt("Send document to (email):")`.
 *
 *    That prompt was the entire send UI: one address, no cc, no subject, no
 *    body, no chance to read what was about to go out, and it fired a
 *    transactional system email that never appeared in the sender's own Sent
 *    folder. A document going to a client is CORRESPONDENCE — it belongs in
 *    the thread with everything else that client was told.
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * ── Why the PDF is vaulted here rather than attached by the client ─────────
 * The composer attaches from the vault by id (`/mail/attachments/from-vault`),
 * so the file has to exist before the draft can reference it. Rendering it here
 * also means the attachment is the SAME artifact the Download button produces
 * and the same one the signature engine writes its artifact hash against —
 * rather than a second render that could differ from what was signed.
 *
 * ── The language is the operator's, chosen at this moment ─────────────────
 * The document, its subject line and its body all come out in one language,
 * decided by the toggle on the document page when they press Send. A French
 * client gets a French sheet under a French subject; that is one decision, made
 * once, and this is where it is applied.
 *
 * ── The counterparty is offered regardless of the caller's party grants ────
 * `signature_request.candidates` resolves who this document is ABOUT — the
 * client on the file, and their contacts. Those addresses come from THIS
 * RECORD, not from a search, so an operations clerk who may raise a transit
 * order but may not browse the client register can still email it to the client
 * it is addressed to. The recipient PICKER is gated separately and stays gated
 * (see mail.service.searchRecipients); this is the one address the document
 * itself supplies.
