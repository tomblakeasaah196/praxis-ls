/**
 * AI action manifest (AI_ARCHITECTURE §2) for the tenant dashboard (MOD-00A).
 *
 * "How are we doing" and "what is moving right now" are the two questions a
 * copilot is asked before any other, and the KPI band and the control tower are
 * where the app already answers them. Reads only — a dashboard computes, it
 * does not hold anything to write.
 *
 * `control_tower`'s options go through `service.controlTowerOptions`, the SAME
 * sanitiser the HTTP controller uses: mode, layer, verification and date field
 * end up in a SQL predicate, and an unrecognised value has to mean "no filter"
 * on this path exactly as it does on that one.
 *
 * `kpiBand` and `kpiCatalogPayload` are absent: both take a `ctx` carrying the
 * caller's scope closure, which `requirePermission` derives over HTTP and an AI
 * tool call never passes through — the same boundary documented in
 * `dashboard/workspace/workspace.ai.js`. Supplying a scope here would be
 * inventing authority; `kpis` carries no such parameter.
