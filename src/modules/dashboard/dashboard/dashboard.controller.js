 * The identity half of a band read, gathered once against the live schema.
 *
 * Kept out of the service because only a request has BOTH handles: this reads
 * pins, role configs and grants (identity — env-pinned), and the tenant half
 * reads business values. The two awaits are SEQUENTIAL on purpose: they share
 * one leased connection (tenant-context.js, PERF S2), and `pg` serialises
 * whatever runs on it — `Promise.all` across the two envs would interleave
 * search_path switches in one connection, which is the nesting bug the pin
 * restore in `withPinned` exists to defuse. Sequential calls make the order a
 * fact of the code rather than of the pool.
