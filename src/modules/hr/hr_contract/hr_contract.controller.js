   * The model call takes seconds, and this deployment runs a
   * 12-connection-per-tenant ceiling — holding a pooled connection across it is
   * how one slow provider takes the whole tenant's pool. So: read the context
   * and release, call the model with no connection held, then write.
   *
   * `llm.chat` is given the client only to resolve the tenant's configured
   * vendor, which is why that read is its own short-lived call rather than
   * being folded into the write below.
