/**
 * Payroll (MOD-17). Orchestrates a monthly run: create → compute (over the active
 * employee roster) → SoD lifecycle → post to the ledger. The arithmetic lives in
 * payroll.rules (verified against KB §9); this service handles state, snapshots
 * the rates in force, and posts a balanced payroll journal on validation.
 *
 * Run lifecycle (schema): OPEN → COMPUTED → SUBMITTED → APPROVED → VALIDATED →
 * DISBURSED, or REJECTED. Segregation of duties: whoever computes shouldn't be
 * the sole approver — enforced via RBAC on the transition routes.
 *
 * GL posting is a guarded, gracefully-degrading step: it builds a balanced entry
 * (661/664 debit; 431/447/422 credit) and posts through journal_entry.service. If
 * the ledger isn't configured (no journal/period/accounts) it records the run
 * without an entry_id rather than failing the payroll.

   *   tax_code          the law, versioned, resolved AT THE RUN'S PERIOD END so a

   *   payroll_config    the per-entity override, which still wins (G18) — a
   *                     negotiated injury class is a deliberate decision and
   *                     overruling it silently would be the worse bug
   *
