 * effective-dated `tax_code` rows on Master data › Tax, and those now reach this
 * engine. `payroll.service.compute` resolves them per period
 * (services/accounting/payroll-rates.js) and layers them over these, with the

 * Compute one monthly payslip.
 *
 * ── GROSS VERSUS NET, AND WHY IT IS NOT A PRESENTATION CHOICE (0698) ───────
 *
 * Two kinds of thing come off a payslip and they must not be confused, because
 * getting it backwards overtaxes or undertaxes the employee:
 *
 *   OFF GROSS — an absence, an unjustified lateness, unpaid leave. The employee
 *   did not work that time and did not EARN that money, so CNPS and IRPP are
 *   computed on the smaller figure. The caller subtracts these before calling
 *   and passes the reduced `gross`.
 *
 *   OFF NET — recovering a salary advance. They earned the full salary and were
 *   taxed on it; in an earlier month they simply received part of it early.
 *   Taking it off gross would hand them a tax rebate for having been lent money.
 *   These are `opts.post_tax_deductions`.
 *
 * @param employee { base_salary, risk_class_rate }
 * @param opts     { gross? overrides base_salary, config? overrides DEFAULTS,
 *                   post_tax_deductions?: [{ label, amount }] }
