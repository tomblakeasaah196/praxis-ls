   * See a device: create it PENDING, or bump `last_seen_at` on the row that is
   * already there. Returns the row either way.
   *
   * ON CONFLICT rather than SELECT-then-INSERT because two punches racing from
   * the same freshly-installed device would otherwise both miss the select and
   * both insert, and the unique index would fail the second — a punch lost to a
   * constraint violation the user cannot act on.
   *
   * `(xmax = 0) AS inserted` distinguishes the INSERT from the UPDATE — an
   * upsert otherwise returns the same row either way, and the caller cannot tell
   * a device it has just met from one it sees every morning. It is the signal
   * that lets the clock ask "name this device?" exactly once, on the punch that
   * created it, instead of nagging on every punch forever.
   *
   * The status is DELIBERATELY NOT in the update list. A revoked device that
   * reappears must stay revoked; letting the upsert reset it to PENDING would
   * make revocation decay back into "nobody has looked yet" every time the
   * device was used again, which is the opposite of what revoking means. The
   * label is only refreshed while it is still the auto-seeded one, so an
   * employee's rename survives them opening the app on a new browser version.
