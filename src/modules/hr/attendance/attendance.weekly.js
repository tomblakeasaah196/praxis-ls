/**
 * The weekly lateness query — raised after the week closes (guide §3.4).
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS ASKS THAT THE DAILY QUERY CANNOT ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * The daily auto-query (attendance.query) asks about a MORNING: "you clocked in
 * 25 minutes late on Tuesday, please explain." It is raised at the punch, while
 * the answer is still recallable, and it is the right question about one day.
 *
 * It is the wrong question about five. Somebody 20 minutes late every day of the
 * week gets five separate queries, each individually answerable ("traffic",
 * "traffic", "traffic"), and nobody — not the employee, not the manager reading
 * the replies — is ever shown the shape of it. The pattern is the thing worth
 * asking about, and no per-day question contains it.
 *
 * So this raises exactly ONE query per person per completed week, naming the
 * count, the total minutes and the dates, and asking about the pattern rather
 * than about any one morning.
 *
 * ── EMPLOYEE ONLY (decision 7) ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Not the manager, not HR. They have analytics — the whole of PR2 exists to
 * answer "who is habitually late" on a screen, on demand, without generating a
 * document against anybody. Mailing them a second copy of a question addressed
 * to somebody else would be a disciplinary record raised against a person by a
 * batch job, which is not what a summary is for.
 *
 * ── EXPECTED WORKING DAYS ONLY, FROM THE CALENDAR ──────────────────────────
 *
 * A LATE row is not on its own proof that the day was owed as work: the
 * reconciler writes one against a punch, and PR1's whole point is that whether
 * a Saturday was a working day is the CALENDAR's answer (employee override →
 * entity calendar → tenant weekend), never the status's. A yard that opens on
 * Saturday and an office that does not produce identical `LATE` rows. So every
 * candidate day is put back through `attendance.calendar` before it counts,
 * and a holiday is dropped for the same reason.
 *
 * ── THE INDEX, WHICH IS THE WHOLE DEDUPLICATION STORY ──────────────────────
 *
 * `hr_rule_id` is NULL on these rows, deliberately, so they fall OUT of 0704's
 * daily index (`… WHERE source <> 'MANUAL' AND … hr_rule_id IS NOT NULL`) —
 * `'WEEKLY' <> 'MANUAL'` is true, so without the null they would land in it and
 * a week ending Sunday the 16th would collide with the lateness query for
 * Sunday the 16th, one silently overwriting the other.
 *
 * But a NULL is distinct from every other NULL in a unique index, so the null
 * alone means NO deduplication at all. 12746 adds the dedicated
 * `ux_hr_query_weekly_week (employee_id, work_date) WHERE source = 'WEEKLY'`,
 * and the upsert below names it. That pair — null rule id, dedicated index — is
 * what makes "one per person per week" structural.
 *
 * ── WHAT A RE-RUN MAY NOT UNDO ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The same rule as the daily query: `status`, `response` and `responded_at` are
 * never touched. Somebody who answered on Monday has answered; the job running
 * again on Tuesday (or a manual backfill) must not reopen it and ask again.
