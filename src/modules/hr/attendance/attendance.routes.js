 *
 * READING a day is `view`, and the caller's OWN days take no grant at all
 * (`/days/mine`) — an employee is always entitled to see what was recorded
 * against them and what it cost.
 *
 * WAIVING is `approve`, not `edit`: it moves money off a payslip. That is the
 * same authority as approving the leave that would have excused the day, and a
 * strictly larger one than correcting a punch.
 *
 * RE-RUNNING a date is `edit`. It writes rows and can create a charge, but it
 * only ever recomputes what the rules already say — and it must be reachable
 * by whoever corrected the punch that made it wrong, not only by an approver.

 * `/mine` takes no MOD-14 grant, exactly as `/days/mine` does not: your own
 * attendance is yours to read. The split is by ROUTE rather than by a `scope`
 * parameter so the grant is a property of the path — a flag that widens what
 * you can see is one typo away from being the whole authorization story.
 *
 * Declared BEFORE `/:id` for the usual reason, and `/analytics/mine` before
 * `/analytics` so the more specific path is not shadowed.
