/**
 * Currency 360 (MOD-08) — one call returns everything the per-currency dossier
 * renders, modelled on entity-360 but far smaller: the tenant record, its
 * catalogue facts (ISO numeric, canonical name/symbol/decimals, the countries
 * that trade in it), the rate history vs base with its sparkline, the last feed
 * sync and the manual-override audit, and where the currency is used across the
 * system.
 *
 * Built to render for a currency with ZERO rates and ZERO usage — every list
 * defaults to [] and every figure to 0 — so a just-added currency shows a
 * working page that explains what is missing, not an error.
 *
 * The base currency has no base→self pair, so its rate blocks are empty by
 * construction (a currency is always 1:1 with itself); the client shows the
 * "base" state instead of an empty rate table.
