/**
 * Entity renewals (MOD-01) — pure rules over documents, registrations and tax
 * registrations that expire.
 *
 * This is what makes the module load-bearing rather than a filing cabinet. An
 * expired tax clearance in Cameroon stops you bidding on contracts; nobody is
 * going to remember to check a table.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE HARD-BLOCKS. The severities are INFO, WARN, ESCALATED and
 * SOFT_BLOCK_RECOMMENDATION — a RECOMMENDATION, which a human acts on. HARD_BLOCK
 * is reachable only through an explicit human endpoint, exactly as 0511
 * established for parties ("a rule never writes HARD_BLOCK"). A system that
 * freezes a company's invoicing because a certificate scan is late has made an
 * operational judgement it is not entitled to make.
 *
 * Lead time is per document type, then per document, then a default — a customs
 * bond that takes six weeks to renew has to warn earlier than a licence that
 * takes two days, and that is data, not code.

 * A registration array is HISTORY, not an ordered lifecycle: the row that

 * nothing about expiry may promote a different row to its place. Per
 * (country, kind):
 *

 *   2. with no primary, a sole row is selected; two or more are ambiguous and
 *      NO row is current — guessing would monitor history;
 *   3. `verified` and `expires_on` are gates, not selectors — an unverified or
 *      expired selected row stays selected (a fallback would silently swap the
 *      number a renewal is about).
 *
 * `verified`/`verified_at`/`verified_by` ride on the row already (0515) and
 * survive PR-04 redaction, which deletes only the number.
 *
 * @returns {{ selected: object[], ambiguous: Array<{country_code: string, kind: string, rows: number, reason: string}> }}
 *          `ambiguous` is the data-quality finding the contract asks for: the
 *          keys where no row could be selected, reported rather than swallowed,
 *          because an expiring registration the list silently dropped is worse
 *          than one it names.
