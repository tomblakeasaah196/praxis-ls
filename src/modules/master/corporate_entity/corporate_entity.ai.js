/**
 * AI surface for MOD-01.
 *
 * The reads are what let the assistant answer the questions this module exists
 * to make answerable — "who are the directors of SLAS", "which entities do we
 * have in France", "does our France entity's cap table balance". `get_entity_360`
 * is one call rather than five because the assistant should not have to know the
 * child-collection layout to describe an entity.
 *
 * `get_entity_360` here is the RAW aggregation: unlike the HTTP route it has no
 * `req` to resolve governance from, so it is registered with an edit permission
 * and returns the unredacted dossier. The permission is the gate.
