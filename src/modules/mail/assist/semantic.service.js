/**
 * SEARCH BY MEANING (§8.9).
 *
 * The mailbox's keyword search finds "demurrage" in threads containing the word
 * "demurrage". §8.9's toggle is for the other question — "when did we last
 * argue about storage charges at Douala" — where the operator remembers the
 * situation and not the vocabulary.
 *
 * ── HOW THREADS GET INTO THE CORPUS ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `ingestThread` writes ONE card per thread into the tenant's `ai_document` /
 * `ai_chunk` corpus, replace-by-`source_ref`, through the SAME
 * `services/ai/ingest.service` every other entity uses. Not a mail-specific
 * embedding path: a second one would need its own vectorization gate, its own
 * idempotence and its own dimension agreement with the retrieval side, and the
 * first time any of the three drifted, mail would be the corpus that silently
 * stopped matching.
 *
 * It inherits that service's `ai.vectorization` gate, so a tenant that has not
 * opted into embedding never has its correspondence vectorised. This matters
 * more for mail than for a schema card: email is the most sensitive corpus in
 * the product and "we embedded it because the feature existed" is not consent.
 *
 * ── THE VISIBILITY RE-FILTER IS NOT OPTIONAL ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `ai_document.confidentiality` is a coarse tag; §9.5's rule is per-thread and
 * depends on connection membership, ownership and explicit shares. So the
 * vector search returns CANDIDATE thread ids, and every one is then re-read
 * through `triage/visibility`'s single predicate before it is returned. The
 * embedding layer can never be the thing that decides who sees a thread —
 * otherwise a PRIVATE thread becomes readable the moment someone phrases a
 * query that resembles it, which is a leak with no audit trail and no obvious
 * symptom.
 *
 * Both halves are needed: without the ingest there is nothing to search;
 * without the re-filter the search is a bypass around §9.5.
