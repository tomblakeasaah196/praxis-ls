/**
 * The AI surface (§8.11).
 *
 * Three things about this file are load-bearing and easy to undo by accident.
 *
 * 1. EVERY ROUTE PASSES `actor(req)` INTO THE SERVICE. The grounding whitelist
 *    re-checks RBAC per source against the CALLER — mail's own MOD-72 grant
 *    says nothing about whether this user may read invoices — and a service
 *    called with no user withholds every source. Dropping the argument does not
 *    throw; it silently produces an ungrounded draft. That is precisely the
 *    failure this chapter was rebuilt to remove, so it is stated here rather
 *    than left to be noticed.
 *
 * 2. `requireFeature("mail.ai")` is the FLOOR, not the gate. The real gate is
 *    `assist.service.assertAiOn`, which also resolves the platform ceiling, the
 *    tenant's own preference, the caller's grant and the budget. The middleware
 *    is here so an unauthorised request is refused before it costs a query; it
 *    is not sufficient on its own, and the service does not trust it.
 *
 * 3. THE `mail.ai` GATE IS A PER-ROUTE MIDDLEWARE — NEVER A `router.use` ON
 *    THIS ROUTER. This module mounts at /mail, the same base path as
 *    mail/mail, mail/binding, mail/triage and the rest, and the module loader
 *    discovers them alphabetically: this router is the first /mail a request
 *    meets. A router-level `router.use(requireFeature("mail.ai"))` therefore
 *    ran for every /mail/* request that fell through to it — with AI off (the
 *    flag's default) it answered FEATURE_DISABLED for GET /mail/threads,
 *    GET /mail/folders and GET /mail/mailboxes/mine before they ever reached
 *    mail.routes.js. The whole inbox was unreachable for every tenant that
 *    had not opted into AI, while the Platform Console correctly showed
 *    "Mail AI: off". The gate is applied to each /assist/* route below; a
 *    route added without it fails the test in
 *    tests/security/mail-ai-gate-scope.test.js, not the customer's inbox.

 * predicate, so a caller who knew (or guessed from a deep link) a thread id
 * could POST /assist/draft and receive a generated reply built from a PRIVATE
 * thread's transcript plus the ERP facts of its bound entity — and /assist/
 * summary additionally WROTE that transcript-derived text into
 * `email_thread_summary`, where the same unscoped SELECT served it back on
 * every later call.
 *
 * The OCR route was worse in kind: it resolved an arbitrary attachment id, read
 * the vault bytes and sent them to an external VISION vendor. An ungated id
 * there did not merely disclose a private thread's file, it exported it to a
 * third party — a supplier invoice's bank details leaving the building.
 *
 * The route's own header (note 1 above) is about grounding RBAC, which was
 * correctly implemented. The visibility question was simply never asked of
 * these routes; these three middlewares ask it.
