/**
 * SLA clocks on tenant business hours (§9.2).
 *
 * PURE given hours, holidays and `now`. A thread arriving Friday 16:30 with a
 * 4-business-hour SLA is due Monday 10:30, not Saturday.
 *
 * ── WHY THE TIMEZONE IS NOT OPTIONAL ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The first version of this file computed with `getDay()` and `setHours()`,
 * which read the *server's* zone. `business_hours.timezone` exists precisely
 * because those are two different things: the API runs wherever it is deployed
 * and the office opens at 08:00 in Douala. On a UTC container that is an hour
 * out every day of the year — enough to move a Friday-16:30 arrival to the
 * wrong side of closing, and to turn a Monday-10:30 due time into Monday 09:30:
 * a breach reported an hour early, every time, silently.
 *
 * §9.10 criterion 5 makes the same point in the other direction: the
 * recipient-local scheduler must render 09:00 Paris as 08:00 Douala in summer
 * and 09:00 in winter. Both need an IANA zone and real DST arithmetic rather
 * than a fixed offset, so the zone helpers below are exported for that caller.
 *
 * Everything here works in absolute time (a `Date`) and converts to and from
 * wall-clock only at the boundaries, which is the only arrangement that
 * survives a DST transition landing inside a business day.
