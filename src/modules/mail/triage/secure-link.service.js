/**
 * Secure ephemeral links (§9.4) — minting, listing, revoking, and SERVING.
 *
 * ── WHAT WAS MISSING ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `GET /public/secure/:token` returned `{ label, target_kind, expires_at }`.
 * It never returned the document. It never wrote `secure_link_view`, so the IP
 * and user-agent columns migration 10758 created were dead, `view_count`
 * incremented with nothing behind it, and nothing reached the CRM timeline.
 *
 * That last part is the one that matters commercially. §9.4: link views are
 * "the ONLY open signal in the product, and it is precise, first-party and
 * unaffected by image blocking. It is the reason Q32's answer costs you nothing
 * commercially." Q32 removed open tracking on the strength of this existing.
 *
 * ── THE TOKEN IS NEVER STORED ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Only its SHA-256. A lookup hashes the presented token and matches on the
 * hash, so a dump of `secure_link` yields nothing usable — the same discipline
 * `proposal.share()` already proved, which is what §9.4 says to model this on.
