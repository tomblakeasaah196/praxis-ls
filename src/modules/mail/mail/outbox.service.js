/**
 * Drafts, and the send queue that makes undo-send possible.
 *
 * ── SENDING IS A QUEUE, NOT A FUNCTION CALL ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `send()` here writes a row and returns. It does not open an SMTP connection,
 * and the HTTP request does not wait for one. The message leaves when the
 * flusher picks it up, a few seconds later.
 *
 * That gap is not latency to be apologised for — it is the feature. Undo exists
 * only because the send has not happened yet, and cancelling is one UPDATE with
 * a rowcount check, so the race against the flusher is settled by Postgres
 * rather than by a timer in a browser that may be closed by then.
 *
 * ── THE PAYLOAD IS FROZEN AT ENQUEUE, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE ────────────────
 *
 * Everything the message needs — recipients, both body parts, the resolved
 * attachment ids, the origin headers, the Message-ID — is serialized into
 * `payload` when the user presses Send. The flusher reads only that.
 *
 * The alternative, re-deriving from the draft at flush time, means what leaves
 * is whatever the draft happened to say a few seconds later. Someone who edits
 * a draft in another tab, or a signature that changes in between, would alter a
 * message that a person already read and approved. Nobody would ever see it
 * happen.
 *
 * ── WHERE THE THROTTLE IS CHECKED, AND WHY TWICE ────────────────────────────
 *
 * At enqueue, so the user is told immediately and does not discover twenty
 * minutes later that their message never went. And again at flush, because the
 * queue can hold a burst that was individually under the cap and collectively
 * over it — the check at enqueue cannot see messages that are not sent yet.
