/**
 * SQL for the thread/message model.
 *
 * Split from mail.repo.js, which keeps the connection and identity access it has
 * always had. This file owns conversations, messages, per-user state, folders and
 * labels — the things 10731 and 10732 introduced.
 *
 * ── EVERY citext[] READ IS CAST TO text[] — THIS IS NOT OPTIONAL ────────────
 *
 * `participants`, `to_address` and `cc_address` are `citext[]`, which buys
 * case-insensitive comparison on addresses. The cost is that node-postgres has
 * no type parser for it: `citext` comes from an extension, so its array OID is
 * not one of the built-ins pg knows how to decode, and it hands back the RAW
 * POSTGRES LITERAL as a string — `"{a@b.cm,c@d.cm}"` — instead of an array.
 *
 * Nothing complains. The row looks fine in a log. Then the first `.filter` or
 * `.join` on it throws, and because these feed the inbox list, one uncast
 * SELECT takes down the entire Mailbox screen behind an error boundary. That is
 * exactly what happened after PR-1A shipped.
 *
 * So: `::text[]` on every read of one of these columns, including inside
 * `SELECT t.*`, where the cast is appended as a same-named column because
 * Postgres allows the duplicate and node-postgres keeps the LAST one. Writes
 * need no cast — pg sends a JS array as `text[]` and Postgres coerces it going
 * in. `scripts/check-citext-arrays.js` fails the build on a read that forgets.
 *
 * ── ONE PLACE DECIDES WHAT A USER MAY SEE ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `accessibleConnections` is the single predicate for "which mailboxes is this
 * person allowed to read" — their own personal one, plus every shared or
 * delegated mailbox they hold a live grant on. Every list, get, search and count
 * in this file goes through it. A second copy of that rule is a leak, so there
 * is not one.

/**
 * ── AND THE SECOND PREDICATE: PER-THREAD VISIBILITY (PR-5 §9.5) ─────────────
 *
 * `accessible` answers "which MAILBOXES may this person open".
 * `vis` answers the finer question "which THREADS inside those mailboxes may
 * they see" — Private / Team / Company. They are different rules and both are
 * required: a colleague can legitimately hold a grant on a shared mailbox and
 * still have no business reading a thread its owner marked Private.
 *
 * The predicate is defined ONCE, in `../triage/visibility.js`, and applied here
 * at every read: list, get, stream counts, label-apply and the CRM timeline.
 * `tests/security/mail-visibility-wiring.test.js` asserts each of those call
 * sites still carries it, because the failure mode is silent — a query that
 * drops the clause returns MORE rows, never an error, and every unit test that
 * exercises the predicate directly keeps passing while the product leaks.
 *
 * Every query using it must have `email_connection` joined as `c`, since
 * PRIVATE resolves through `c.owner_user_id`.

/**
 * ── THE TRIAGE FIELDS, UNDER THE NAMES THE CLIENT READS ─────────────────────
 *
 * `TriageBar` renders the SLA due line, who holds the composer lock, and the
 * assignee's name. Every one of those was `undefined` at runtime, for two
 * separate reasons, and neither produced an error — the bar just quietly drew
 * nothing and offered "Claim this" on a thread somebody had already claimed.
 *
 *   · `listThreads` selected an explicit column list that included none of the
 *     §9.2 columns at all. The whole triage bar was blank in the list.
 *   · `getThread` uses `SELECT t.*`, so it returned the columns — under their
 *     DATABASE names. `assigned_user_id`, `first_response_due_at` and
 *     `sla_breached_at` are not `assigned_to`, `sla_due_at` and `sla_breached`,
 *     and an optional field that never arrives is indistinguishable in TypeScript
 *     from one that is legitimately absent.
 *
 * Neither the client tests nor the server tests could see it: the client mocks
 * the API, so it was asserting my invented shape against my invented shape.
 * `scripts/check-response-contract.js` is what caught it, which is exactly the
 * job it exists to do.
 *
 * Defined once and shared by both queries, because the bar renders from the
 * list AND from the detail, and the two disagreeing is how this started.
 *
 * The lock join is deliberately `expires_at > now()` — an expired lock is not a
 * lock. §9.2 is emphatic that it is advisory, and showing "Thierry is writing a
 * reply" twenty minutes after Thierry closed his laptop is worse than showing
 * nothing.

 * a hole. `accessible` alone is what the legacy detail read and `getMessage`
 * had, and it lets a member of a shared mailbox open a colleague's PRIVATE
