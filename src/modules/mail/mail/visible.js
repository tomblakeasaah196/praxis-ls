/**
 * §9.5 at the ROUTE layer — the gate the audit's C-4 says was missing.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
 *
 * The visibility predicate itself has always been correct and has always lived
 * in exactly one place (`triage/visibility.js`). What was missing was any
 * discipline about *applying* it: the list, the detail read, search, the
 * timeline and AI grounding all went through repo builders that carry it, and
 * roughly thirty other thread-scoped routes — notes, cards, suggestions, bind,
 * snooze, follow-up, lock, shares, OCR, AI draft — reached the same rows by id
 * with nothing checking that the caller may see them.
 *
 * `mail-visibility-wiring.test.js` asserted the predicate on the repo builders
 * and on four named call sites, so every one of those routes passed every gate.
 * The lesson the in-house field notes drew from FN-2 — "a write that RETURNS
 * the row is a read" — was applied to four triage writes and never enumerated
 * across the module.
 *
 * So the predicate moves to where routes cannot forget it. Every thread-,
 * message- and attachment-scoped route in the mail module mounts one of these,
 * and `tests/security/mail-route-visibility.test.js` walks the mounted routers
 * and FAILS on any such route that does not. A new route is now gated by
 * default-or-fail rather than by whether its author remembered.
 *
 * WHY 404 AND NOT 403
 *
 * Every refusal here answers `NOT_FOUND`, identical to a thread that does not
 * exist. A 403 on a private thread confirms the thread is real, which for a
 * conversation whose existence is the sensitive part (a grievance, a
 * termination, an acquisition) is most of the disclosure. This also means these
 * routes cannot be used as existence oracles by iterating ids — which
 * `POST /threads/:id/snooze` and `/followup` previously were, purely through
 * their FK failing differently for a real id than a fake one.
 *
 * WHY A GATE READ AND NOT ONLY AN IN-STATEMENT PREDICATE
 *
 * Both, where a write is involved. The gate answers "may this caller see this
 * thread at all" before any work happens; the predicate riding inside the
 * UPDATE closes the window in which the thread's visibility changed between the
 * two. The four triage writes that already did this are the pattern; this file
 * generalises it rather than replacing it.
