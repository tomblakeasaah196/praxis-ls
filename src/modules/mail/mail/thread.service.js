/**
 * Conversations: listing, reading, moving, and the per-user state that makes a

 *
 * ── WHY "MARK READ" IS NOT A COLUMN UPDATE ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It writes a row keyed on (message, user). Two people working billing@ see
 * different unread counts from the same messages, which is the entire reason the
 * model changed. Anything here that looks like it is asking "is this read" and
 * does not carry a user id is a bug.
 *
 * ── SERVER STATE IS BEST-EFFORT, LOCAL STATE IS NOT ─────────────────────────
 *
 * Marking read and moving folders propagate to the mail server so a user's phone
 * agrees with the workspace, but a provider failure must never block the local
 * change: the user pressed the button, the button has to work. The same
 * discipline the engine already applies to markAsRead.

 * than for nothing, and says which one it picked (`connection_id`) so the

/* ── Deletion (H-1) ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * There was no deletion path anywhere in this module. The bulk verb list ran
 * read/unread/star/unstar/move/label/unlabel, Trash accumulated forever, the
 * provider's Trash was never emptied, and §9.6's promise that "deletion of an
 * archived message is blocked in the service layer" was vacuous — nothing could
 * delete anything, so nothing needed blocking.
 *
 * The shape below makes that promise real rather than removing it:
 *
 *  - A SEALED message is never deleted. `email_archive` covers its body hash and
 *    its attachment hashes, and the chain is a linked list — removing a link
 *    breaks verification for every message after it, which is the one thing the
 *    archive exists to prevent. The database enforces this too (the archive's FK
 *    to `email_message` has no ON DELETE), but relying on a 23503 would surface
 *    as a 500 and tell the user nothing.
 *  - A BLOCKED attempt is ledgered, not silently skipped. "I tried to delete
 *    correspondence that is under retention" is exactly the event a retention
 *    control exists to record, and it is more interesting than the successes.
 *  - Deletion is per-caller-visible. The predicate rides inside the DELETE, not
 *    only on the route gate, so a thread made PRIVATE between the two is
 *    refused by the statement.
 *  - The provider is told, best-effort. A message deleted here and left on the
 *    IMAP server comes back on the next sync, which reads as the product
 *    ignoring the user.
