 * their IT team to check the account — none of which can help, because the
 * protocol itself is closed. Worse, the host they are most likely to enter is
 * `mail.<their-domain>`, which for a domain whose website we host resolves to
 * OUR server: they then authenticate against a local mailbox that is not theirs
 * and see an empty inbox that looks like a working connection.
 *
 * Detection is by MX (`hostedProviderOf`), so it covers a custom domain — the

 * ── EACH ROW BUILDS ITS OWN AppError, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE ────────────────
 *
 * It would be tidier to return `{ message }` and let the caller assemble the

 * invisible: `scripts/generate-api-docs.js` finds every error this product can
 * raise by scanning for `new AppError("LITERAL"` in `src/`, and a code that
 * only ever appears as a table VALUE is a code that silently drops out of
 * `doc/ERROR_CODES.md`. That doc is the contract a client switches on —
 * `smtp-errors.ts` keys a fix guide on `MAILBOX_AUTH_FAILED` — so a code the
 * client handles and the docs do not list is exactly the drift the gate exists
 * to catch. Writing the literal here keeps the scan honest.
 *
 * The codes therefore repeat the map's, and `mail-send-classifier.test.js`
 * asserts they still match — reaching each one from a REAL SMTP rejection
 * rather than from this list, so a row that has drifted fails.
 *
 * The ONE deliberate rename is auth: the send path says `MAILBOX_AUTH_FAILED`
 * rather than `SMTP_AUTH_FAILED` because the client has a distinct fix guide
 * for it ("edit this mailbox") and `smtp-errors.ts` already resolves the word
 * "login" to that code. Its 422 is deliberate too — see the row.

 * ── IT PRESERVES THE CLASSIFIER'S VERDICT, AND THAT IS THE POINT ────────────
 *
 * `mapSmtpError` sorts a rejection into five outcomes: auth, sender, recipient,
 * TRANSIENT (421/451/452, greylisting, "try again later"), and a hard 5xx
 * refusal. The last two are the same HTTP status — both 502, because from the
 * API's point of view both are "the remote server did not take it" — and they
 * are opposite operational facts: one should be retried and the other must not
 * be.
 *
 * This function used to flatten both into one `MAIL_SEND_FAILED`, so
 * `outbox.retryPlan` — which decides retries from the code — could not tell
 * them apart and retried both. A message the recipient's server refused for
 * being too large was sent again at 30s, 2min and 8min, against a server that
 * had already said no three times in RFC-defined language, before the person
 * who could have shortened it or sent a secure link instead was told anything.
 * Which is exactly what `retryPlan`'s own header says it exists to prevent:
 * "trying a rejected sender address three times does not make it work; it just
 * delays telling the person something only they can fix, and burns three more
 * entries in the mail host's abuse log."
 *
 * It also made two of the client's fix guides — `SMTP_SEND_REJECTED` and
 * `SMTP_SEND_FAILED` in `smtp-errors.ts` — unreachable from a send, because no
 * send ever produced those codes.
 *
 * So: the verdict survives, the wording is overlaid, and `MAIL_SEND_FAILED` is
 * now only what it says on the tin — a send that failed for a reason the SMTP
 * classifier could not name at all.
