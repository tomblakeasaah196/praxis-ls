/** Mail — per-purpose sender identities + outbound log (read-only view), PLUS the

 *  send / reply. See doc/EMAIL_ENGINE_PLAN.md. feature:null keeps the module always
 *  mounted (unchanged); a dedicated `mail` feature_state key can gate it later.
 *
 *  RBAC (added 2026-08-02, doc/ORGANOGRAMME_AUDIT_2026-08-02.md finding C2). Until
 *  now every route below sat behind authMiddleware and NOTHING else, so the lowest-
 *  privilege user in the tenant could read the whole inbox, any thread and its
 *  attachments, any client's full correspondence timeline, and send mail AS the
 *  company mailbox. Gated on MOD-72 (Mail & Correspondence), seeded in
 *  migrations/seeds/9130_mail_module.sql with default grants in 9022.
 *
 *  Why its own key rather than riding MOD-64 (Smart Comms) as smartcomm.routes.js
 *  does: MOD-64 is internal staff messaging, this is external client correspondence
 *  plus the credentials to send as the company. Granting one must not grant the
 *  other. The key is catalogued so it appears in the permission matrix — a key that
 *  is absent from platform.module_catalogue has grants for nobody and 403s every
 *  non-CEO user (the MOD-29 lesson, session 17).
 *
 *  Action mapping: reads → view; sending, replying and linking a thread to a record
 *  → create (they produce correspondence); marking read → edit; mailbox connection
 *  management → edit, because a connection holds credentials and rebinding one
 *  redirects the company's mail. */

 * ── THE TWO FLAGS THAT GATE PR-1 ────────────────────────────────────────────

 * `mail.core` and `mail.composer` are seeded by `10730_mail_defaults_and_flags`
 * and, until this line, gated nothing: 71 routes in this file, `feature: null`
 * at the bottom, and not one `requireFeature` anywhere. Q5 is explicit that
 * every mail surface is "all on for Smart Logistics, off for every other
 * tenant" — so a flag nobody checks meant every tenant on the deployment had
 * the mailbox, the composer and the send queue live regardless of what their
 * `feature_state` said. The Platform Console projected OFF and the API answered
 * anyway, which is the worst kind of gate: visible, trusted and inert.
 *
 * Applied per SECTION rather than to the whole router, because this file also
 * carries PR-0's setup surface — connections, mailboxes, catalogue, send points
 * — and that MUST stay reachable while the flags are off. Otherwise an admin
 * cannot configure mail for the tenant they are about to enable it for, and the
 * first thing the feature does is lock them out of turning it on.
 *
 * `requireFeature` fails CLOSED on a missing row, which is the right direction:
 * a tenant provisioned before the flag existed gets no mailbox rather than an
 * ungoverned one.
