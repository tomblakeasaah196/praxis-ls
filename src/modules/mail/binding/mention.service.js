/**
 * Mention fan-out (§7.4) — three channels, exactly once each.
 *
 * The rule from the guide, verbatim in shape: on note save, for each mention,
 * write the `mention` row and then notify ONCE via
 *   1. in-app   — notification.service, category MENTION, deep-linked to the thread,
 *   2. chat     — a compact card in the mentioned person's direct channel,
 *   3. push     — the existing web-push path.
 *
 * As merged, only (1) happened. (3) came free with it — `notification.notify`
 * already fans out to push — but (2) did not exist, which is the half the brief
 * described most concretely ("goes to the in-house chat box directly").
 *
 * ── WHY THE CHAT CARD DOES NOT RAISE ITS OWN NOTIFICATION ───────────────────
 *
 * `smartcomm.postMessage` notifies every other member of the channel. Left
 * alone, a mention would therefore arrive twice — once as a mention, once as
 * "new message in Smart Comms" — from ONE logical event, which is exactly what
 * addition (f)'s dedup rule forbids. The card is posted with
 * `notifyMembers: false`; the mention notification is the one that fires.
 *
 * Deduplication lives in `notification.service` behind `dedupeKey`, per the
 * MUST in §7.4 ("applied in the service, not per caller"). The key here names
 * the NOTE, not the thread, so two separate notes that both mention you are two
 * notifications — being mentioned twice is two events.
