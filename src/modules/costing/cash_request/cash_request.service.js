 *      an edit is unambiguous even when the label and the amount both change;

 *      line, and a request holds at most one per budget line in practice;
 *   3. neither → a new line.

 *   Q5  An OPS request needs an APPROVED_LOCKED costing to be submitted at all.
 *       Refused at SUBMIT rather than later: the lines COME from the costing,
 *       so a request without one is not a request needing a stricter approver,
 *       it is an empty form — and the requester is the person who can fix it.
 *   Q4  Every OPS line must name a budget line. No money leaves without a
 *       costing; unbudgeted spend means amend the costing, not annotate the
 *       request.
 *   Q3  A line claiming more than its budget has left may be SUBMITTED with a
 *       written reason — the reason tells the approver to go and amend the
 *       sheet — and may not be APPROVED. The refusal carries the costing's id
 *       and reference so the screen can offer the unlock in one click.
 *
 * An overhead request has no costing and none of this applies to it; it is
 * governed by its cost centre and its written justification instead.

 * DISBURSED. `cash_request_payment` — one-to-many, with a treasury account, a
 * date and an entry_id, hardened by 0498 and CHECKed by 0497 — was never
 * written to by anything. So a request the treasury could only fund in two
 * tranches read as fully disbursed the moment the first franc moved, and the
 * second tranche had nowhere to go.
 *
 * EACH INSTALMENT ISSUES ITS OWN RÉGIE ADVANCE. A régie advance is a quantity
 * of cash in a holder's hands from a date: two payments a fortnight apart are
 * two advances, each with its own issue posting, its own policy window and its
 * own aging clock. Topping up the first would restate an amount its own ledger
 * entry contradicts. The advance is linked from the PAYMENT row
 * (`cash_request_payment.regie_advance_id`, UNIQUE); `cash_request.regie_advance_id`
 * keeps pointing at the first so every pre-10719 reader stays correct.
 *
 * `amount` is optional and defaults to the whole outstanding balance, so the
 * common case — one payment for the full request — is unchanged for callers,
 * and the client need not send an amount it does not have a reason to vary.

 * headroom that does not really exist.
 *
 * `settled_amount` per line is what releases it: the ledger reads
 * COALESCE(settled_amount, claim), so a settled request commits only what it
 * spent. The split is pro-rata because instalments are paid against the
 * request, not against its lines, and the last line absorbs the remainder so
 * the parts sum to the cash actually issued, exactly.
 *
