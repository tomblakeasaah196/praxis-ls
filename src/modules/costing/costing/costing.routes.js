// service type's tiered charge set and prices it — so gating it on `create`
// would stop a validator seeing what the author was offered.
//
// It also resolves expense rates server-side, deliberately: the client used to
// call `GET /expense-rates/resolve` once per line, which is N round trips AND
// requires the caller to hold MOD-10 (Expense Rates) just to have a costing
// price itself. One call, gated on the module that owns the document.

 * Chase whoever is holding a pending costing (12774).
 *
 * `view`, not `edit`. It changes nothing about the sheet — it sends a reminder
 * about one — and the person who most needs it is the requester whose cash
 * request is blocked, who often holds no costing rights at all. Gating it on
 * `edit` would hand the chase to exactly the people who are not waiting.
 *
 * The abuse it might invite is answered by the quota rather than by the grant:
 * three a day per sheet, refused with 429 (costing.rules.NUDGE_DAILY_LIMIT).

//   capability  Authorising a costing is an APPROVER act — the SoD overlay on
//               top of the module grant. Applied ONLY to the decision states:
//               demanding APPROVER to submit would be the same bug as demanding
//               `approve` to submit. CEO bypasses both.
