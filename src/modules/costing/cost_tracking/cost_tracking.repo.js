 * (0230:38) is a real per-dossier row with its own `entry_id` and
 * `applied_amount`, because cash from a client is a liability (Cr 4191) that is
 * later drawn down by the final invoice — not an attribute of a cost line. A
 * client does not advance money "against Demurrage"; they advance it against
 * the file.
 *

 * the cost-tracking surface, so `total_advance`, `total_balance` and
 * `coverage_percentage` had no equivalent. This is that join.

/**
 * The portfolio sheet — one row per dossier that has a costing or a cost entry.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Both cost-tracking routes were `/dossier/:dossierId/…`, so
 * the module could only ever answer "this one file". The legacy's master sheet
 * and KPI view were portfolio-wide, and "which files are over budget" is not a
 * question you can ask a per-dossier endpoint without N round-trips.
 *
 * WHY ONE QUERY WITH THREE SUBQUERIES rather than a view: the legacy's three
 * DATABASE VIEWS are exactly what could not be recovered (no schema dump was
 * ever committed — see doc/COST_TRACKING_LEGACY_COMPARISON.md §0), and a view
 * here would have to be maintained in a migration while this evolves. The
 * aggregates are scoped per dossier in scalar subqueries rather than joined and
 * grouped, because three LEFT JOINs against costing_line, cost_entry and
 * advance would multiply rows and silently inflate every SUM — the classic
 * fan-out. Each subquery is independently correct.
 *
 * `budget` counts APPROVED_LOCKED costings only, matching approvedBudgetTotal:
 * an unapproved draft is not an authorised budget to be measured against.
 *
 * Reads `dossier_visible` (0671:82), not the base table. This ENUMERATES, and a
 * DRAFT dossier is half-finished wizard state rather than a file — it has no
 * business appearing on a cost sheet. tests/unit/dossier-draft-isolation
 * enforces this and caught the first draft of this query reading `dossier`.
