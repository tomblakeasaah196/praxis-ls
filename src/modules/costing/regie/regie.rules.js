/**
 * Régie d'avance decision logic (KB §6.8) — pure, no DB.
 *
 * An advance sits validly in 581. It is NEVER auto-allocated to 4731. Past its
 * policy window, if still unjustified, the OPEN balance reclassifies 581 -> 4211
 * (a receivable from the holder). This module decides "is it aged?", "how much
 * is open?" and "what state does that put it in?"; the postings go through the
 * ledger engine.
 *
 * WHY A TRANSITION TABLE NOW. Before 10717 there was none, and `ageOne` wrote
 * `state: "AGED_UNJUSTIFIED"` directly with no guard. That is how three of the
 * five states in the DB CHECK (0230:29) became unreachable — nothing else ever
 * wrote `state` at all.

 *
