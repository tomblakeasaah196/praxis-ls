/**
 * Régie d'avance (MOD-49, KB §6.8).
 *
 * Issue posts Dr 581 / Cr <treasury>. Retirement — the part that did not exist
 * before 10717 — posts Dr 4731 (per dossier) / Cr 581 for a receipt, Dr 571 /
 * Cr 581 for returned cash, Dr 658 / Cr 581 for a write-off, and is what makes
 * 581 net to zero. Aging past the policy window reclassifies the OPEN balance
 * Dr 4211 / Cr 581 (a receivable from the holder) — never auto-allocated to
 * 4731 — and is reversible via `unage` when the holder finally produces
 * receipts.
 *
 * TWO RULES THIS FILE ENFORCES THAT ARE EASY TO GET WRONG
 *
 * 1. The advance's `justified_amount` / `returned_amount` are a CACHE. They are
 *    recomputed from `regie_retirement` on every change, never incremented. An
 *    increment drifts the moment a retirement is corrected, and those two
 *    columns are what `openBalance` — and therefore aging — depends on.
 *
 * 2. Every account and journal code comes from tenant settings
 *    (`finance.regie`, seed 9094). The JS fallbacks below are last-resort only.
 *    NOTE the treasury fallback is '5211', not '521': 521 is a non-postable
 *    grouping (9000:77) and the ledger trigger `assert_line_valid` (0640:150)
 *    rejects it outright.
