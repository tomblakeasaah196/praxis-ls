 *      escalation — the delayed job checks it when it fires.
 *   2. The ack is broadcast to the OTHER devices of the same callee, so the
 *      desk tab and the phone stop ringing together rather than each waiting
 *      to time out. It goes to the user's own room, never to the caller: the
 *      caller's UI is already saying "Ringing…" and has nothing to do with
 *      which of the callee's devices heard it first.
 *   3. Nothing else. Accepting the call is `acceptCall`; this is only "the bell
 *      was heard", which is why a late ack on a call that has already moved on
 *      is a quiet no-op rather than an error.
 *
 * Idempotent by construction: a second ack from a second device returns null
 * from the guarded UPDATE and is not re-broadcast.
