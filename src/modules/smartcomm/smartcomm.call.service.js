/**
 * Smart Comms Calls (PR-1) — server-authoritative 1:1 call state machine.
 *
 * The server owns the call row: it creates it (RINGING), moves it to IN_CALL,
 * and closes it (ENDED / NO_ANSWER / CANCELLED / DECLINED / BUSY / FAILED).
 * Clients are renderers — a client that lies about the state changes nothing,
 * because every transition is a guarded UPDATE that only matches the status
 * it is leaving. Each call's deadlines are delayed jobs of its own
 * (smartcomm.call.clock.js, audit D1), re-checked against the ROW when they
 * fire, and a 5-minute safety sweep over tenants with calls backs them up. A
 * process restart therefore loses no deadline.
 *
 * Media never touches this process. This file deals in state and socket
 * signals only; the actual audio is P2P (STUN, TURN as the last tier).
