/**
 * API F-22 — the declared RBAC action must describe what the endpoint DOES.
 *
 * Eight write endpoints were gated on `view`, so granting a role "MOD-64: view"
 * also granted "add and remove channel members" and "archive a channel". An
 * administrator configuring the permission matrix had no way to know that; the
 * matrix said read and the routes meant write.
 *
 * Two kinds of write are distinguished here, because they are genuinely
 * different rights and collapsing them would be its own inaccuracy:
 *
 *   `edit`   — changes something OTHER PEOPLE see: channel membership, the
 *              archived flag, another message's content or existence.
 *   `view`   — changes only the CALLER'S OWN relationship to a channel: their
 *              pin, their mute, their read marker, their draft, their star,
 *              their reaction. These are per-user rows keyed on the caller and
 *              are meaningless to anyone else, so requiring a write grant to
 *              mute a channel you can already read would be the opposite
 *              mistake. They keep `view`, now deliberately and in writing.
 *
 * Membership remains the real authorisation in every case — `assertMember` in
 * the service — and that is unchanged. This is about the permission matrix
 * telling the truth.
