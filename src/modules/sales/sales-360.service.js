/**
 * The 360° dossiers for the front of the funnel: a LEAD and a QUOTE REQUEST.
 *
 * Same shape and the same contract as the masters' `party-360.service.js`,
 * deliberately, because a reader who knows one should not have to learn
 * another: one call returns the record, a KPI block, and every collection that
 * points at it, and it renders for a BRAND-NEW record with zero data — every
 * figure defaults to 0, every collection to [].
 *
 * ── WHY THESE TWO NEEDED ONE ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * F6 split what the legacy overloaded into one column across three rows: the
 * lead carries the commercial funnel, the quote request carries the intake
 * lifecycle, the opportunity carries the pipeline stage. That split is correct
 * and it is the whole point of the feature — but it left a salesperson with
 * three registers and no single place that answers "what is going on with this
 * company". The meetings are on a fourth screen, the proposals on a fifth. This
 * is the join the split made necessary.
 *
 * ── ONE CLIENT, SEQUENTIAL QUERIES ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every query here runs on the SAME pg client, which cannot execute two at
 * once, so these are sequential by nature — the same note treasury-360 carries.
 * Each collection is capped (LIMIT 25, timeline 50); a lead with more than 25
 * proposals is a data problem, not a rendering one.
 *
 * ── MONEY IS GATED ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Proposal totals and opportunity value are money, so they follow the masters'
 * rule rather than inventing a second one: `canSeeFinancials` (a read grant on
 * Treasury, MOD-09; the CEO sees all) decides, and without it the figures are
 * `null` and `money_visible` is false. Null, not zero — "you may not see this"
 * and "this is worth nothing" are different facts, and a tile showing 0 for the
 * first is a lie. The counts are never gated: how many proposals exist is not
 * confidential.
 *
 * NOTE ON RULE 1 (doc/SALES_CRM_FEATURES.md). Nothing here reaches a model, but
 * the same discipline applies: no cost or margin column is named in any query
 * below. Proposal value is a SUM over `proposal_line.qty * unit_price` — the
 * sell side, the number already printed on the client's own proposal.
