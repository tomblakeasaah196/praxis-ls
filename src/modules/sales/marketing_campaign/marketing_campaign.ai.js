/**
 * MOD-22 in the assistant's tool catalogue.
 *
 * NOT an AI generator — this file registers the module's operations so the
 * assistant can call the SAME service the screen calls, with the caller's own
 * RBAC (CONVENTIONS.md, "Adding an AI action"). Every write is `confirm: true`,
 * so it is proposed as an action card the user confirms, never executed
 * straight off a chat turn.
 *
 * The approval decision is deliberately ABSENT. "Approve the Q3 campaign" is
 * exactly the sentence a user would try, and exactly the one the assistant must
 * not be able to satisfy: approving a budget is the control this feature adds,
 * and a confirm-gated action card is a weaker record of who approved it than a
 * deliberate click on the campaign — the approver's identity is the point.
 * Recording performance figures IS here, because a weekly "put 43 leads and 4
 * wins on the freight campaign" is the chore the register exists to make cheap.
