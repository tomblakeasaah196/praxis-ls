/**
 * Inbound intake (MOD-25) — the contact enquiry desk (F9,
 * doc/SALES_CRM_FEATURES.md), plus the partnership functions F10 is moving out.
 *
 * A message from the website's contact form arrives, gets classified, gets
 * answered, and either closes or becomes a lead — or, when it is a partnership
 * offer, a partnership request in F10's register.
 *
 * FOUR THINGS THIS LAYER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR.
 *
 * 1. STATUS IS THE CORRESPONDENCE, AND NOTHING ELSE. Every status move goes
 *    through `transition`, which asserts the move against
 *    `rules.NEXT` — there is no path that writes `status` from a patch body.
 *    The old shape had triage write `TRIAGED` or `CLOSED` directly, which is
 *    both an unguarded free-text status write (Block A forbids porting those)
 *    and the overloaded column F9 exists to unpick.
 *
 * 2. TRIAGE DOES NOT TOUCH THE STATUS. Raising a lead from an enquiry is not an
 *    answer to the person who wrote in. Under the old shape it silently moved
 *    the row out of the unread pile, so an enquiry could be "handled" with
 *    nobody ever replying. Triage now writes `lead_id` /
 *    `partnership_request_id` and leaves the correspondence exactly where it
 *    was.
 *
 * 3. A REPLY IS SENT, AND THE ATTEMPT SURVIVES ITS OWN FAILURE. `respond` puts
 *    a PENDING row down and COMMITS it before calling the mail engine, then
 *    settles it to SENT or FAILED. So a reply that dies mid-send — process
 *    restart, SMTP timeout with no answer — leaves a visible "we tried" row
 *    instead of nothing, and the operator is not retrying blind. Only a SENT
 *    row moves the enquiry to RESPONDED, which is what makes the Responded tile
 *    mean something.
 *
 *    The dual-write hazard is real and is stated rather than hidden: the mail
 *    is out of our hands the moment nodemailer returns, so a crash between the
 *    send and the settle leaves a PENDING row against a delivered email. That
 *    is why PENDING is a visible state on the screen and not an internal one —
 *    the honest answer to "did this go out" is sometimes "we do not know", and
 *    `email_send_log` (written by email.service on every attempt) is where the
 *    operator settles it.
 *
 * 4. THE KPI TILES PARTITION. `list` folds the GROUP BY through `rules.kpiFrom`
 *    and asserts the tiles sum to TOTAL before the response leaves.
