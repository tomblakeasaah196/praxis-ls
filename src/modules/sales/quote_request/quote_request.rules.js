/** Quote request (MOD-20-intake) — pure lifecycle and KPI arithmetic.
 *
 * TWO RULES, AND THEY ARE THE FEATURE.
 *
 * 1. `quote_request.status` is the INTAKE lifecycle and nothing else. Pipeline
 *    stages live on `opportunity.pipeline_stage_id`; the commercial funnel
 *    lives on `lead.status`. The legacy overloaded one column with all three,
 *    which is why its live register reports "converted: 0" against 26 rows.
 *
 * 2. THE TILES PARTITION THE SET. Every status value belongs to exactly one
 *    tile, and the tiles sum to TOTAL — under every filter combination, with no
 *    row left over. That is not a display detail: a register whose counters do
 *    not add up is the exact failure F6 exists to correct, and it is very easy
 *    to reintroduce by adding a status and forgetting a tile.
 *
 *    So the tiles are DERIVED from STATUSES here rather than hand-listed, and
 *    `assertPartitions()` proves it. A seventh status added tomorrow either
 *    lands in a tile or fails the test; it cannot silently vanish from the
 *    summary the way CLARIFICATION_REQUIRED and CLOSED_NO_ACTION did.
 *
 * "Is this converted" is one query, never two: `converted_opportunity_id IS NOT
 * NULL`, kept in step with `status` by the trg_quote_request_sync_converted
 * trigger. The legacy computed it in the row renderer AND in the drawer, and
 * the two disagreed, so a converted row greyed out in the list while the drawer
 * still offered Convert.
