/**
 * The shell arrangement. `railPins` and `towerPins` are bounded on BOTH axes
 * because they are the fields here a client could grow without limit: the rail
 * is a strip of icons roughly a dozen tall and the Control Tower shortcuts
 * grid is capped at eleven user-chosen cards, so a request carrying two
 * hundred is not a preference, and the row it would write is billed to the
 * tenant's database rather than to whoever sent it. The keys are opaque to the
 * server (the client owns which shortcut a key names), so length is the only
 * check worth making — an allow-list here would mean redeploying the API to
 * add a shortcut.
 *
 * Both pin arrays use the same envelope on purpose: one shape, two audiences,
 * so the client's "absent = untouched, null = cleared" rule reads identically
 * on the two lists.

/**
 * `kpiPins` — the four tiles this user chose for the headline band, in

 * at the edge, unlike its neighbours, because the bound here is the layout
 * promise, not a sanity guard: `xl:grid-cols-4` never reflows, and a fifth id
 * would not make a fifth tile — it would make a preference that silently
 * loses part of itself at render. Rejecting at the edge says so at save time
 * instead. Ids are checked for SHAPE only; the resolver drops anything that is
 * not in the catalog, so a tile retired in a later release degrades to "less
 * band" rather than to a rejected write.
