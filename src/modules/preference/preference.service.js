/**
 * Per-user preferences — the personal layer over tenant-wide `setting`.
 *
 * TWO SECTIONS, both personal, both scoped to the caller:
 *
 *   appearance  the three typography tokens
 *   shell       how this user has arranged the application chrome — whether the
 *               ribbon is pinned open, and what they pinned to the icon rail
 *   calls       the per-user half of the noise-filter switch (PR-3, guide
 *               §4.4/§7.2): the tenant sets the default for the yard, the person
 *               standing in the yard decides whether their own mic is filtered
 *
 * SCOPE, AND WHY `appearance` IS THIS NARROW. Only the three typography tokens
 * are user-overridable. Colour, logo and favicon are the COMPANY's identity, not
 * the operator's: letting a user restyle the brand would mean two people
 * looking at the same screen on a call and disagreeing about what the product
 * looks like, and it would make every support screenshot unreliable. Type is
 * different — it is an ergonomics setting, like density or zoom, and the person
 * reading nine hours of waybills is the one who should choose it. So the
 * allow-list below is a deliberate boundary, not a first instalment.
 *
 * WHY `shell` IS ON THE SERVER AND DENSITY IS NOT. Density lives in
 * localStorage because it is a property of the SCREEN you are sitting at — a
 * 27" monitor and a warehouse tablet want different answers from the same
 * person. Which shortcuts you pinned is the opposite: it is a property of how
 * you work, and rebuilding it on every device you sign in from is the reason
 * nobody customises anything.
 *
 * ABSENT ≠ NULL. A key the user has not overridden has no row, and the API
 * returns null for it, meaning "inherit the tenant value". PUT-ing null for a
 * key deletes the row — that is the reset. There is no third state.
 *
 * NOT AUDITED, ON PURPOSE. Every other write in this codebase emits an audit
 * event; a personal font choice is not a governance event, and writing one
 * ledger row per user per fiddle with a dropdown would bury the entries that
 * matter. The row's own updated_at is the whole history anyone needs.
