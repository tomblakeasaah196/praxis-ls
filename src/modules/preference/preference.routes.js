/**
 * Per-user preference routes — the self-service surface, mounted at
 * /api/tenant/me/*.
 *
 *   GET    /me/preferences/appearance     this user's typography overrides
 *   PUT    /me/preferences/appearance     partial update; null clears a token
 *   DELETE /me/preferences/appearance     clear all three → tenant default
 *   GET    /me/preferences/shell          ribbon + icon-rail arrangement
 *   PUT    /me/preferences/shell          partial update; null clears a key
 *   GET    /me/preferences/calls          the noise-filter switch this user owns
 *   PUT    /me/preferences/calls          partial update; null = tenant default
 *
 * The shell section has no DELETE. "Reset the rail" is `railPins: null`, which
 * the partial PUT already expresses, and a section-wide reset would also clear
 * the one-time rail hint — re-teaching someone a thing they have already
 * learned, every time they tidy their shortcuts.
 *
 * AUTHENTICATED, BUT NOT PERMISSION-GATED — and that is the point. Tenant
 * branding sits behind MOD-70 edit because it changes what everyone sees;
 * these rows change what exactly one person sees, and that person is the
 * caller. Requiring a grant would mean an operator needs Settings-edit — a
 * permission that also lets them rewrite the company's brand — to enlarge their
 * own body font. There is no id in the path for the same reason: the subject is
 * always req.user, so no request can address another user's preferences.
