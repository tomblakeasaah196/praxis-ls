 * Widened 2026-08-04 (audit OBS-L4 / SEC-L4). Three things were wrong, and the
 * third one bit the first version of this very fix:
 *
 * 1. **Pino path matching is LITERAL, not substring.** `*.password` matches a
 *    key named exactly `password`. It does not match `password_hash`,
 *    `refresh_token`, `access_token`, `totp_secret_enc` or `secret_enc` — all
 *    of which were being written in full.
 *
 * 2. **The worst leak was not a named field at all.** `logger.error({ err, sql })`
 *    in config/database.js and middleware/error-handler.js serialises a pg error
 *    object, and a unique-violation carries
 *        detail: "Key (email)=(someone@example.com) already exists"
 *    so a duplicate-signup attempt wrote a customer's address to disk in plain
 *    text, from a call site that looks entirely innocent.
 *
 * 3. **A wildcard spans exactly ONE intermediate level, and does not cover the
 *    top level at all.** `*.password_hash` matches `{ user: { password_hash } }`
 *    but NOT `{ password_hash }` — so a list that looked complete still let
 *    `logger.info({ password_hash: row.password_hash })` through. Both forms are
 *    generated from SENSITIVE_KEYS below so neither shape can be missed, and
 *    `req.body.user.password` is listed explicitly because it sits two levels
 *    down.
 *
 * ORDERING CONSTRAINT: this had to land BEFORE log shipping (OBS-L7, Phase 2).
 * Shipping first exports every one of the above to a third party, and you
 * cannot un-send it.
 *
 * REDACT_PATHS is exported so tests/unit/log-redaction.test.js asserts against
 * the list that actually ships rather than a copy — a copy drifts, and then the
 * test guards something that is no longer what runs.

/**
 * Attach the ambient tenant/user to EVERY log line (audit OBS-L3, Critical).
 *
 * The audit found that of ~120 logger call sites, not one carried a tenant
 * identifier and only a handful carried a user. In a database-per-tenant ERP
 * that means an error spike cannot answer the first question anyone asks in an
 * incident — "is one tenant broken, or is everyone broken?"
 *
 * The obvious fix is to add `{ tenant }` to 120 call sites. That is the wrong
 * fix twice over: it is a large mechanical diff that will miss some, and every
 * log line written afterwards has to remember. A pino `mixin` runs on every
 * line and reads the AsyncLocalStorage that `config/request-context.js` already
 * populates for RLS — so existing call sites need no edit, and new ones cannot
 * forget.
 *
 * Notes:
 *   - `require` is inside the function to avoid a require-time cycle:
 *     request-context is dependency-free, but logger is required extremely
 *     early (env.js, boot) and this keeps the edge one-directional.
 *   - Nothing is emitted when there is no context — background workers, crons
 *     and boot legitimately have none, and `tenant: null` on every line of a
 *     worker log is noise, not signal.
 *   - Explicit fields WIN. `mixinMergeStrategy` puts the call site's own object
 *     last, so `logger.info({ tenant: other }, …)` is not silently overwritten
 *     by the ambient value.
 *   - `cross_tenant` is surfaced rather than hidden: a CEO/group request reading
 *     across tenants is exactly what you want to be able to find later.
