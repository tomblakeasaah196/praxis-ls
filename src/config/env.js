/**
 * TC-E2 — NOT BROADENED, and the attempt is worth recording so the next person
 * does not repeat it.
 *
 * The finding is that this guard keys solely on `NODE_ENV === "production"`,
 * while the defaults it protects are published in this repo. The obvious fix is
 * to add corroborating signals. Both candidates are wrong here:
 *
 *   APP_BASE_DOMAIN — defaults to "praxisls.com" (line 35), i.e. the DEFAULT is
 *     already production-shaped. Tripping on "domain is not localhost" throws on
 *     every developer machine, every unit test and every CI job, all of which
 *     legitimately run on the dev secrets. Written, then caught before it
 *     shipped by asking what the default actually is.
 *
 *   DB_HOST — is `postgres` in docker-compose, which is ALSO what production
 *     uses, because it is a compose service name. So "host is not local" never
 *     fires where it matters and does fire for a developer pointed at a remote
 *     database. Exactly backwards.
 *
 * And the scenario the audit worried about is narrower than it reads: the
 * Dockerfile sets `ENV NODE_ENV=production` on the runtime and worker stages, so
 * `docker compose run --rm api node scripts/…` INHERITS it and is already
 * guarded. The genuine residual is a process started outside Docker on the host
 * with NODE_ENV unset — where the schema default is "development" (line 33).
 *
 * The real fix is therefore to stop having exploitable defaults at all
 * (generate per-install secrets, or make these three required with no default),
 * which is a behaviour change needing sign-off — not a cleverer sniff. Left as
 * reported rather than shipping a guard that fires everywhere except production.
