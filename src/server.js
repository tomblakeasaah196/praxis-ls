   * Tower rendered the Lovable mock in an `<iframe srcDoc>` that inherited this
   * page's CSP, with an inline `<script>` bridge and inline `onclick=`
   * handlers. The cost was that the primary XSS mitigation was switched off for
   * every page including login — and because the refresh token lives in web
   * storage (SEC-L3), a single XSS bought thirty days of account access.
   *
   * PHASE 3 / AUDIT F1 DELETED THAT IFRAME. The Control Tower is real React
   * now; the `onclick=` handlers survive only in comments describing what the
   * mock used to do. So the relaxation had already stopped protecting anything
   * and was purely a liability nobody had gone back to remove — which is worth
   * noticing as a pattern: a documented, deliberate exception outlived its
   * reason silently, because nothing ties an exception to the thing that
   * justified it.
   *
   * VERIFIED BEFORE REMOVING, since this fails closed and loudly if wrong:
   *   - `client/index.html` and `platform-console/index.html` carry exactly one
   *     script each, `<script type="module" src="/src/main.tsx">` — external,
   *     satisfied by `'self'`.
   *   - `vite-plugin-pwa` is configured `injectRegister: false`, so the build
   *     injects no inline registration script; the built `dist/index.html` has
   *     one `<script>` tag.
   *   - The two remaining `srcDoc` iframes (document preview, template preview)
   *     use `sandbox=""` and `sandbox="allow-same-origin"`. Neither grants
   *     `allow-scripts`, so scripts cannot run in them at all and they need no
   *     script-src.
   *
   * `img-src` STAYS relaxed: tenant-authored branding (login hero, logos)
   * legitimately points at external https URLs, and `blob:`/`data:` are used by
   * generated previews. That is a real requirement, not a leftover.
