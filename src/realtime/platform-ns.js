/**
 * Socket.IO namespace for the platform console — `/platform`.
 *
 * WHY A SEPARATE NAMESPACE RATHER THAN REUSING realtime/index.js
 *
 * The existing realtime layer is built for TENANT users and cannot carry this
 * traffic, for two independent reasons — either alone would be fatal:
 *
 *   1. Token type. `authenticate()` rejects anything whose `typ` is not
 *      "access". A platform token carries `typ: "platform"` (middleware/
 *      platform-auth.js), so every console socket would be refused with
 *      INVALID_TOKEN.
 *   2. Host resolution. It resolves the handshake Host against the tenant
 *      registry and requires status LIVE. The console is host-gated to
 *      admin.praxisls.com, which is not a tenant host and never resolves —
 *      TENANT_UNAVAILABLE.
 *
 * Loosening either check on the shared connection handler would let a tenant
 * user reach platform channels, which is precisely the boundary PRD §5.3
 * exists to hold. A namespace with its own `use()` middleware keeps the two
 * authentication models apart, and rooms inside it stay platform-only.
 *
 * ROOMS
 *   `errors:all`          every error, the default console view
 *   `errors:t:<slug>`     one tenant's errors
 *   `errors:platform`     platform-wide (NULL-tenant) errors only
 *
 * Publishing goes through the Redis adapter attached in realtime/index.js, so
 * an error captured on replica A reaches a console connected to replica B. That
 * is not a nicety: with the adapter absent, a multi-replica deploy delivers the
 * feed to whichever admins happen to share a process with the crash.
