/**
 * The signature card catalogue and the eligibility funnel
 * (doc/SIGNATURE_ENGINEERING_GUIDE.md §3.3, §3.4).
 *
 * ── The funnel ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   1. DOC-TYPE CEILING    document_vault.types.js — { signable, allowsWet,
 *                          allowsQes }. Code, not tenant-editable. A payslip is
 *                          never wet-signed; a delivery note never needs QES.
 *          ↓
 *   2. TENANT MENU         setting signature_policy.<DOC_TYPE>
 *                          { allowed: [...], default: "STAMP" }
 *          ↓
 *   3. SENDER, AT DISPATCH two booleans, not a menu:
 *                          requireCertified → collapse to CERTIFIED alone
 *                          allowPaper       → keep or drop PRINT_SIGN
 *          ↓
 *   4. SIGNER CHOICE       the cards the signing page renders.
 *
 * ── Why the sender gets booleans and not a preset list ─────────────────────
 * Every digital card is AES_OTP: STAMP and DRAWN differ in appearance, never in
 * legal weight. A sender picking between them is choosing a LOOK on the
 * signer's behalf — which is precisely the choice the signer was meant to make.
 * The only sender decisions that change the EVIDENCE are whether third-party
 * certification is required and whether paper is acceptable. So the control is
 * two checkboxes, and the multi-select with its subset validation is gone.
 *
 * ⚠ resolveMenu MUST run server-side on every render of the signing page. A
 *   menu resolved once at dispatch and trusted thereafter would keep offering a
 *   card after the tenant turned it off.
