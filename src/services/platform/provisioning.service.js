 * WHY THIS IS A FUNCTION AND NOT SIX LINES INSIDE `ensureTenantRole`.
 *
 * Schema-level grants and default privileges are attached to the SCHEMA, and
 * `wipeSandbox` drops the sandbox schema and builds a new one. The new schema
 * carries none of them, and nothing re-granted — so every sandbox rebuild left
 * the app role unable to see its own sandbox. The wipe is meant to run on a
 * CRON (kickoff §6, every 14 days), which means this was not a one-off local
 * mishap: it silently broke TEST mode for every tenant on a schedule.
 *
 * WHAT MADE IT HARD TO SEE. Postgres does not answer "permission denied" for a
 * schema the caller cannot USE — an inaccessible schema is skipped during name
 * resolution, so the error is `42P01 relation "feature_state" does not exist`.
 * The tables were there the whole time, visible to any superuser holding a
 * psql or pgAdmin session, which is exactly the tool anyone reaches for to
 * check. The evidence and the symptom pointed in opposite directions.
 *
 * Default privileges are attributed to the role that CREATES an object, and
 * migrations run as the superuser, so they must be declared FOR that role —
 * otherwise a table added by a LATER migration is unreadable again.

/**
 * A bare SQL identifier, validated then quoted.
 *
 * GRANT takes no parameters — a role and a schema are identifiers, not values,
 * so `$1` is not available and the name must be interpolated. That makes this
 * the one place in the file where a string reaches SQL as syntax, and it is
 * therefore the one place that has to prove the string cannot BE syntax.
 *
 * Deliberately narrower than Postgres allows, and the same shape as the check in
 * shared/db/query-helpers.js: lower-case start, then letters, digits, hyphens
 * and underscores, to Postgres's own 63-character NAMEDATALEN limit. Every schema
 * and role this system creates fits it — `live`, `sandbox`, `public`, and
 * `praxis_<slug>` where the slug already passed `m.slugOk`.
 *
 * The hyphen is allowed BECAUSE of the superuser name: `TENANT_DB_SUPERUSER` is
 * operator configuration (default `postgres`), and a real deployment names it
 * e.g. `praxis-admin`. The old pattern rejected the hyphen, so `grantSchemaToRole`
 * threw `refusing to build SQL from an invalid superuser name` mid-wipe — after
 * the sandbox rebuild had already committed — leaving a freshly rebuilt schema
 * with no grants for the app role. A hyphen cannot escape a double-quoted
 * identifier, so it is safe here; the thing this check exists to reject is a
 * double quote.
 *
 * Quoting alone would NOT be enough: a name containing a double quote would
 * close the quoted identifier and escape. The pattern check is what closes that,
 * and the two are done together so neither can be applied without the other.

 * runs this on every deploy, so the split happened during a deploy, while the
 * new image — which expects the new schema — was rolling out to all of them.
 *
 * A tenant left behind does not fail loudly. It fails the next time a query
 * touches a column that migration was going to add, as a 42703 from deep inside
 * a feature, on one tenant, hours later.
 *
 * CONTINUE RATHER THAN STOP, deliberately. If the cause is tenant-specific data
 * then stopping punishes every tenant after it in the list for one tenant's
 * problem. If the cause is systematic then continuing costs a few more seconds
 * and produces the far more useful message "all 12 failed" instead of "the
 * first one failed". Either way the outcome is enumerated per tenant, which is
 * the part that was missing: the caller can see exactly which databases are on
 * which side of the line.
 *
 * Throws AFTER the sweep if anything failed, so a deploy still goes red — the
 * change is that it goes red having done as much as it safely could and having

/**
 * Rebuild a tenant's sandbox schema from scratch.
 *
 * DATA 5.6. This used to run DROP SCHEMA → CREATE SCHEMA → ledger DELETE →
 * re-apply on a bare client with no transaction. The window between the DROP
 * and a successful rebuild is the dangerous part: a crash, a dropped
 * connection or a failing migration file left the tenant with NO SANDBOX
 * SCHEMA AT ALL and a ledger that still claimed the sandbox scopes were
 * applied. TEST mode then failed for every user of that tenant, and the next
 * migrate pass would not rebuild it because the ledger said there was nothing
 * to do.
 *
 * Postgres CAN roll back DDL — `DROP SCHEMA` and `CREATE SCHEMA` are
 * transactional here, unlike `CREATE DATABASE` in provisionTenant — so the
 * whole rebuild genuinely is all-or-nothing. On failure the tenant keeps the
 * sandbox it had.
 *
 * The cost is that the schema is locked for the duration of the rebuild rather
 * than being briefly absent. That is the correct trade: a sandbox that is
 * unavailable for thirty seconds is an inconvenience, and a sandbox that has
 * silently ceased to exist is an incident.
 *
 * AUDIT (2026-08-22 incident). Every successful rebuild now writes ONE
 * `sandbox.wiped` row into platform.platform_audit and stamps
 * `last_sandbox_wipe_at`, whoever asked for it. Before this, a
 * `DROP SCHEMA … CASCADE` was the only destructive platform action that left
 * no trace anywhere an operator can read: a tenant lost a night's sandbox data
 * and the console could not say whether a person, the cron or a deploy box had
 * done it. `source` is how the row answers that, so callers pass one:
 *
 *   console   — the platform-console button (carries actorId + ip)
 *   scheduler — the sandbox-wipe worker (no actor; a machine did it)
