/**
 * WS-B3 — restore rehearsal. The part that makes a backup real.
 *
 * §3.2 states the problem exactly: backups are "neither scheduled centrally nor
 * ever rehearsed today, which means it is not yet a backup." WS-B1 fixed the
 * first half. This fixes the second, and it is the more important half — a dump
 * file is a claim about recoverability, and an unrehearsed claim is worth
 * roughly nothing. The failure modes that matter (a dump that restores but is
 * empty, a dump truncated by a crash, a `pg_restore` version mismatch, a schema
 * that restores without its sequences) are all invisible until someone tries.
 *
 * This is a SCRIPTED, SCHEDULED DRILL rather than a document: restore into a
 * throwaway database, run integrity probes against the restored copy, record
 * the measured RTO to `platform.restore_drill`, drop the scratch database.
 *
 * WHY IT RESTORES INTO A SCRATCH DATABASE AND NEVER OVER THE ORIGINAL
 *
 *   A drill that could touch the live tenant database is a drill nobody will
 *   schedule, and correctly so. The scratch database is named with
 *   RESTORE_DRILL_DB_PREFIX and dropped in a `finally`; the restore path
 *   REFUSES to target anything not carrying that prefix unless the caller is a
 *   real recovery explicitly asking for it (`allowNonDrillTarget`).
 *
 * WHAT THE PROBES ACTUALLY CHECK
 *
 *   Not "did pg_restore exit 0" — that is nearly worthless, since it exits 0 on
 *   an empty dump. The probes compare the restored copy against the LIVE source:
 *   table counts, row counts on core tables within tolerance, and a
 *   trial-balance recompute (debits = credits) on the ledger, which is a
 *   property that must hold in any correct copy of the data and fails loudly on
 *   a partial restore.
