/**
 * WS-H1 / WS-H2 — per-tenant fleet health.
 *
 * §3.1's goal is that "50 tenants are as observable and recoverable as 5". The
 * signals largely exist already — `registry.poolStats()`, `fleetSchemaStatus()`,
 * the metrics endpoint, `/api/health/ready`. What did not exist is aggregation
 * per tenant, over time, with one shared definition of "bad".
 *
 * THE FAILURE MODE THIS IS FOR
 *
 *   The process is up. Postgres is up. Redis is up. Thirty-nine tenants are
 *   serving normally and one tenant's database is refusing connections. Every
 *   fleet-wide metric reads green, because at the fleet level everything IS
 *   green — the platform is not broken, one tenant is. That tenant finds out by
 *   telephoning someone.
 *
 *   WS-H2's synthetic liveness probe is the direct answer: an actual query
 *   through that tenant's own pool. Not "can the process reach Postgres" but
 *   "can this tenant's request path complete", which is the only question a
 *   tenant cares about.
 *
 * ONE STATUS FUNCTION, USED BY BOTH READERS
 *
 *   `statusFor()` is the single place GREEN/AMBER/RED is decided, and its
 *   verdict is STORED rather than re-derived on read. If the console computed
 *   its own colour and alerting computed another, they would disagree exactly
 *   when it mattered — during an incident, which is the one time two systems
 *   telling different stories is unaffordable.
