/**
 * Vault-first runtime configuration, with `.env` as the fallback.
 *
 * THE RULE THIS IMPLEMENTS
 *
 *   Anything that CAN live in the platform settings vault does. `.env` holds
 *   only two kinds of thing: a fallback for a deployment that has not been
 *   configured yet, and the settings that cannot come from the vault at all.
 *
 *   The second category is small and it is a hard constraint, not a preference:
 *   the vault lives IN the platform database, so anything needed to REACH that
 *   database (DB host, pooler host, credential cache TTL) can never be read
 *   from it. Alongside those sit Postgres's own settings (which the app does not
 *   apply), the pooler password (which must match what the container was
 *   started with, or the two silently drift), and the job schedules (read once
 *   when the worker registers its repeating jobs, so a console change would
 *   report success while nothing had changed).
 *
 * ── TWO ENTRIES, NOT FIFTEEN ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   `storage.backup` — where backups are written, and the credentials for it.
 *                      A secret, so it uses the encrypted half of the vault.
 *   `ops.tuning`     — the numeric knobs: retention, thresholds, timeouts.
 *                      No secret; one panel instead of six.
 *
 *   Grouping them is deliberate. A setting per vault row would mean a console
 *   panel per setting and a round trip per read, and these values are read
 *   together anyway.
 *
 * ── WHY EVERY READ IS CACHED, AND WHY IT NEVER THROWS ──────────────────────
 *
 *   These are read on hot paths — every backup, every probe, every WAL segment.
 *   A platform-DB round trip per read would be a real cost, so a short TTL
 *   makes the common case free while keeping a console change effective within
 *   seconds rather than needing a restart.
 *
 *   And a vault read that fails degrades to env rather than propagating. The
 *   alternative is that a hiccup in the platform database stops backups,
 *   probes and archiving — turning a settings lookup into an outage of the
 *   machinery that exists to survive outages.

/**
 * The call relay, as the API describes it to browsers.
 *
 * ── WHY ONLY HALF OF THE TURN SETTINGS ARE HERE ────────────────────────────
 *
 * `.env` holds thirteen TURN_* variables and this reads five of them. The
 * split is not arbitrary and it is not a migration half-done: the two halves
 * are read by two different programs.
 *
 *   THE API reads host, ports, transports and the STUN list to build the
 *   `iceServers` array a browser is handed. That array is a DESCRIPTION of
 *   the relay. A description can live in a database and change between one
 *   call and the next, because nothing is bound to it.
 *
 *   COTURN reads the realm, the listening and external IPs, the certificate
 *   paths, the port range and the quotas — from a file it renders once at
 *   start (docker/coturn/docker-entrypoint.sh). Those are BINDINGS and
 *   identity. A console cannot change what a daemon listens on, and a
 *   setting that reports success while changing nothing is worse than no
 *   setting at all (the rule at the top of this file, and the reason the job
 *   schedules are excluded too).
 *
 * TWO OF THEM ARE READ BY BOTH, and that is the trap. `TURN_PORT_UDP` and
 * `TURN_TLS_PORT` are coturn's listener AND part of the URL we advertise.
 * They stay env-only here ON PURPOSE: making them settable would let the
 * console advertise `turns:host:443` while coturn still listens on 5349 and
 * the firewall still drops 443 — a change that looks like it worked and
 * breaks every relayed call. The console shows them read-only instead, and
 * the Test button proves what the relay is actually doing.
 *
 * `TURN_CREDENTIAL_SECRET` is env-only for the same reason the pooler
 * password is: the API signs with it and coturn verifies with it, so a value
 * only one of them can see puts the two out of step and every credential is
 * refused. Moving it needs coturn reading its secret from Redis and an
 * overlapping rotation, which is its own change.
