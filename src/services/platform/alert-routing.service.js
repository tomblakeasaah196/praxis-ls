/**
 * WS-ER1 — severity→channel routing, and the per-tenant error surface.
 *
 * The Error Command Center already exists: `error-reporter.js` posts to
 * ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL, `error-escalation.service.js` evaluates rules, and
 * `server.js` warns at boot when no destination is set. What was missing is
 * everything between "an error happened" and "the right person hears about it":
 *
 *   - ONE destination for everything means either the channel is noisy enough
 *     that people mute it, or it is quiet enough that it misses things. Routing
 *     by severity is what lets a fatal page someone while a warning goes to a
 *     channel nobody is woken by.
 *   - Ops events that are not application errors — a failed backup, a RED
 *     tenant, a failed restore drill — had no path to a channel at all. Those
 *     are the ones §3.2 and §3.1 exist to surface, and they were being written
 *     to a log nobody reads on a schedule.
 *
 * WHY A FAILED ALERT IS LOGGED AND NEVER THROWN
 *
 *   Alerting sits on the failure path by definition. If it can fail loudly it
 *   turns one incident into two, and the second one masks the first. Everything
 *   here resolves; nothing rejects.

 *                                   absence §3.2 is about.
 *   restore.drill.failed   page   — the backups cannot be trusted. Worse than a
 *                                   failed backup: it means the ones you have
 *                                   may not restore.
 *   integrity.corrupt      page   — silent data corruption, and every hour it
 *                                   goes unnoticed is another backup cycle
 *                                   faithfully preserving the damage.
 *   tenant.red             page   — a tenant cannot serve.
 *   host.down              page   — an availability incident.
 *   backup.stale           notify — no backup in the RPO window, but no failure
 *                                   either: usually a job that stopped running.
 *   tenant.amber           notify — degraded, still serving.
 *   integrity.missing      notify — a document the app will fail to produce.
 *                                   Serious, but bounded and not spreading.

 * The destination for a severity.

 *
 *   The vault is the primary store and the console is how it is written — the

 *   follow. `.env` is the last-resort fallback for a fresh deploy that has not
 *   been configured yet, never the place a running deployment is expected to
 *   keep this.
 *
 *   That distinction matters more here than elsewhere: an alert destination is
 *   the setting you most need to be able to change at 3am, and requiring a
 *   redeploy to repoint a webhook means it does not get repointed.
 *
 * ALERT_WEBHOOK_PAGE_URL / `alerts.page` is optional: when unset, `page` falls
 * back to the general channel rather than going nowhere. A misconfiguration must
 * degrade to "too noisy", never to "silent" — silence is indistinguishable from
 * health, which is the exact failure `server.js` already warns about at boot.
 *
 * Never throws: a vault read that fails degrades to env rather than losing the
 * alert. Alerting sits on the failure path, so it must not add a failure.

 * takes a different path out of the building, through the SMTP relay the system
 * already uses for invoices and OTPs. For `page` severity — a failed backup, a

 * credential and is stored encrypted; an address is not, so it lives in the

 * mean an operator could never see which address alerts go to, which is a worse
