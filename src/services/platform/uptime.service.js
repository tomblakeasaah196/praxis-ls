/**
 * WS-U1 — uptime probing and the status-page figures.
 *
 * THE POINT OF PROBING FROM OUTSIDE
 *
 *   Internal metrics cannot see "the process is down". This is the same flaw
 *   0093 documents for `health_sample` and solves by counting EXPECTED samples
 *   rather than recorded ones: a collector inside the thing it measures writes
 *   no row at all during an outage, so a naive `avg(up)` reports 100% for the
 *   week you were paged three times.
 *
 *   This module probes over HTTP, per host, so it at least crosses the network
 *   stack and the router rather than asking the process about itself. Running
 *   the prober outside the deployment entirely is a deployment decision — point
 *   `UPTIME_PROBE_BASE` at the public hostnames and run this from a worker in
 *   another region, or call `probeAll()` from an external cron. The maths below
 *   is honest either way because it uses the same expected-samples denominator.
 *
 * WHY availability USES EXPECTED SAMPLES
 *
 *   uptime% = up_samples / expected_samples, where expected is derived from the
 *   window and the probe interval. A missing sample counts as DOWN. Any other
 *   choice makes the metric blind to the outages that stopped it recording,
 *   which are precisely the outages worth measuring.
