/**
 * WS-B2 — object/system backup, and WS-B4 — snapshot integrity scan.
 *
 * `backup.service.js` protects Postgres. This protects everything Postgres only
 * POINTS AT: vault documents, branding, generated media. Threat 4 in §3.2 is
 * exactly this — "a vault document is deleted or corrupted independently of
 * Postgres" — and a database backup does not cover it, because the rows survive
 * perfectly while the bytes they reference are gone.
 *
 * WHY NOT `rclone`, WHICH THE PLAN NAMES
 *
 *   §3.2 proposes `rclone sync`, and for a very large store it would be faster —
 *   it parallelises and resumes. This is an in-process sync instead, for three
 *   reasons that matter more at the current scale:
 *
 *     - no new external binary to install, version-pin and keep present in every
 *       container the worker runs in;
 *     - it works identically whether the primary is the local driver or S3,
 *       whereas an rclone invocation needs a different remote spec per driver;
 *     - it is testable without a filesystem or a bucket, which is what let the
 *       "deleting from primary must not delete offsite" property below be
 *       asserted rather than assumed.
 *
 *   The trade is honest: this is a serial list-and-copy, O(objects). If the
 *   store outgrows it, swap the body of `syncObjects` for an rclone exec — the
 *   `backup_run` bookkeeping around it does not change.
 *
 * THE PROPERTY THAT MAKES THIS A BACKUP RATHER THAN A MIRROR
 *
 *   It NEVER deletes from the destination. A mirror propagates the deletion that
 *   you are trying to recover from — which makes it worse than useless in the
 *   one scenario it exists for. Retention on the offsite copy is a separate,
 *   time-based decision (`pruneRetention`), never "the source no longer has it".

 * Enumerating from `document_vault` is deliberate and is not just an
 * optimisation. A bucket listing tells you what storage happens to contain; the
 * table tells you what the application BELIEVES it has. The difference between
 * those two sets is the entire finding of an integrity scan — an object present
 * in storage but not the table is orphaned, and one present in the table but not
 * storage is the dangerous case, a document the app will offer to a user and
 * fail to produce. Listing the bucket can only ever find the first kind.

 *               this document and fail. Worst case, and invisible until someone

 *   CORRUPT   — the object exists but its bytes no longer hash to the recorded
 *               `content_hash`. Silent corruption; a restore would faithfully
 *               reproduce the damage.
 *   UNHASHED  — no `content_hash` was ever recorded, so nothing can be checked.
 *               Not damage, but not verifiable either, and worth surfacing
 *               because it is the blind spot in this whole scan.
 *
 * Runs BEFORE a restore needs it, which is the entire point — discovering a
 * corrupt artifact during a recovery is discovering it too late.
