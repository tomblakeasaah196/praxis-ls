/**
 * WS-B1 — per-tenant Postgres backup.
 *
 * Database-per-tenant is what makes this simple: a tenant's entire state is one
 * `pg_dump`, and restoring one tenant never touches another. That property is
 * the strongest argument for the tenancy model, and until now nothing was
 * exercising it — §3.2 is blunt that backups were "neither scheduled centrally
 * nor ever rehearsed today, which means it is not yet a backup."
 *
 * This module is layer 1 of the two D4 ratified: scheduled per-tenant logical
 * dumps, custom format, compressed, written offsite through the backup storage
 * driver, every attempt recorded to `platform.backup_run`. Layer 2 (cluster WAL
 * archiving for point-in-time recovery) is deployment configuration rather than
 * application code — `pgBackRest`/`wal-g` against the same bucket — and is not
 * driven from here.
 *
 * THREE DESIGN POINTS WORTH KNOWING
 *
 * 1. STREAMED, NEVER BUFFERED. `pg_dump` writes to stdout and that stream goes
 *    straight to storage. A real tenant's dump does not fit comfortably in the
 *    worker's heap, and a backup job that OOMs the worker takes out every other
 *    scheduled job with it.
 *
 * 2. THE PASSWORD NEVER APPEARS IN ARGV. `pg_dump` is spawned with PGPASSWORD in
 *    its environment, not `--dbname=postgresql://user:pass@host`. Anything in
 *    argv is world-readable in `ps` output for the life of the process, and a
 *    backup job runs for minutes.
 *
 * 3. CONTINUE ON FAILURE. One unreachable tenant must not stop the fleet's
 *    backup — that is exactly the shape of outage where the OTHER tenants'
 *    backups matter most. Failures become FAILED rows, which is what makes
 *    staleness alertable, and the run reports them without throwing.
