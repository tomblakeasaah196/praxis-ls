 *
 *   Threading it through every one of them means changing signatures across
 *   modules that have no business knowing about billing, and — worse — any
 *   caller that forgets becomes a silent enforcement hole. The check would pass
 *   because it never ran. That is the exact failure mode this work exists to
 *   remove, so it must not be reintroduced by the plumbing.
 *
 *   `acquire()` is the single choke point every tenant connection passes
 *   through, from HTTP requests and from background jobs alike. Stamping the id
 *   here means anything holding a tenant client can resolve its tenant, and

 * its own pools, so three replicas cut the ceiling to ~4 tenants.
 *
 * Three things were missing and are added here:
 *
 *   1. A CAP ON THE NUMBER OF POOLS, with LRU eviction. A tenant that has not
 *      been touched in a while should not hold a pool open forever. The Map is
 *      insertion-ordered, so re-inserting on access makes it an LRU for free.
 *
 *   2. IDLE CONNECTIONS THAT ACTUALLY GO AWAY. `min: 0` plus an explicit idle
 *      timeout means a warm-but-quiet tenant settles back to zero backend
 *      connections instead of holding its full `max`.
 *
 *   3. A SEAM FOR PgBouncer. doc/DB_ARCHITECTURE.md:46 anticipates "PgBouncer
 *      at 10+ tenants" and the code had nowhere to put it. Setting
 *      TENANT_DB_POOLER_HOST routes every tenant pool through the pooler
 *      without touching a line of application code. That is the real answer
 *      above a few dozen tenants; everything else here buys the runway to get
 *      there.
 *
 * What this does NOT do is pretend a single process can serve unlimited
 * tenants. It converts a hard cliff — an unrecoverable connection error on an
 * unrelated tenant's request — into eviction and queueing, which degrade.

 *   and each tenant has its own database and role.
 *
 *   So when pooled: `live` needs no statement at all — the role carries the
 *   search_path as a server-side default — and `sandbox` is pinned inside an
 *   explicit transaction by `withTenantConnection`, which is the only scope in
