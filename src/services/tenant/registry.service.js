 * The measured failure: one `pg.Pool` per tenant DB, `max: 8`, cached in an
 * UNBOUNDED Map. Postgres ships `max_connections=100`, so 12 warm tenants hold
 * 96 backend connections and tenant 13 is refused with "sorry, too many clients
 * already". Horizontal scaling made it worse, not better — each replica opens
 * its own pools, so three replicas cut the ceiling to ~4 tenants.
 *
 * Three things were missing and are added here:
 *
 *   1. A CAP ON THE NUMBER OF POOLS, with LRU eviction. A tenant that has not
 *      been touched in a while should not hold a pool open forever. The Map is
 *      insertion-ordered, so re-inserting on access makes it an LRU for free.
 *
 *   2. IDLE CONNECTIONS THAT ACTUALLY GO AWAY. `min: 0` plus an explicit idle
 *      timeout means a warm-but-quiet tenant settles back to zero backend
 *      connections instead of holding its full `max`.
 *
 *   3. A SEAM FOR PgBouncer. doc/DB_ARCHITECTURE.md:46 anticipates "PgBouncer
 *      at 10+ tenants" and the code had nowhere to put it. Setting
 *      TENANT_DB_POOLER_HOST routes every tenant pool through the pooler
 *      without touching a line of application code. That is the real answer
 *      above a few dozen tenants; everything else here buys the runway to get
 *      there.
 *
 * What this does NOT do is pretend a single process can serve unlimited
 * tenants. It converts a hard cliff — an unrecoverable connection error on an
 * unrelated tenant's request — into eviction and queueing, which degrade.
