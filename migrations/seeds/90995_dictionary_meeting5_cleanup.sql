-- ============================================================================
-- SEED (per tenant schema) — 90995 financial dictionary clean-up agreed in the
-- tenant review of 21 Sep 2026 ("meeting 5").
--
-- A SEED, NOT A MIGRATION, because it edits catalogue rows that 9080/9082
-- create. On a freshly provisioned tenant the whole migration set runs BEFORE
-- the seeds, so a tenant migration would find an empty dictionary and do
-- nothing, and 9080 would then seed the old shape. The name sorts after 9098
-- and inside the /^90/ tenant-seed glob (migrator.js), so 9080 and 9082 have
-- always run first.
--
-- Three things, in this order:
--
--   1. DOCUMENTATION FEE IS A DISBURSEMENT (01:04:57, 01:44:14). It was seeded
--      as our own revenue (7061, output VAT). The company rules it is paid on
--      the client's behalf and re-billed at cost, so it becomes a disbursement
--      with the 4731 pair and no VAT, and it goes on the BASIC list for Sea
--      Freight Import so "Suggest charges" offers it on every such file.
--
--   2. A CODE'S LETTER FOLLOWS ITS DIRECTION (01:20:04). Until now changing a
--      line's direction kept its old code, so a disbursement could carry #R.
--      The service re-letters on every direction change from this release;
--      this repairs the rows that drifted before it — including the
--      documentation fee from step 1 — using the same lowest-free-number rule
--      as `financial_dictionary.repo.nextCode`. The old code is appended to the
--      description, as 9082 did, because a seed writes no audit row.
--
--   3. TITLES ARE TITLE CASE (01:44:14 — "titles that come with small letters").
--      Every word of label_en and label_fr starts with a capital; the rest of
--      each word is left alone, so "THC", "PDF", "(BL)" and "IT" survive —
--      unlike initcap(), which would print "Thc". Same rule as
--      `financial_dictionary.rules.titleCase`, which the service applies on
--      every save from this release.
--
-- IDEMPOTENT. Step 1 is guarded on the direction it changes; step 2 only
-- touches a row whose letter disagrees with its direction; step 3 only writes a
-- label that title-casing would change. A second run changes nothing.
