-- ============================================================================
-- TENANT DB — 0668 Marks tokens: how a container type prints on a B/L line.
--
-- WHY THIS EXISTS
--
-- Legacy generated "Marks & Numbers" from the container lines and made the
-- field read-only: 1 × 20' Reefer and 2 × 40' HC printed as `01*20'RF, 02*40'HC`
-- (operations-registry.php:641). That string is read by the final invoice, the
-- transit order, the delivery note and both costing packages — five documents
-- that would change what they print if we invented a new vocabulary. We are not
-- inventing marks; we are recovering a generator we regressed into a free-text
-- box.
--
-- The generator needs one thing the registry does not carry: the token legacy
-- prints for each type. `20HC` (the rate-lookup key in `extra.size`) is not
-- `20'HC` (what a B/L line says), and `REEFER` is not `RF`. Deriving it every
-- time would work for the seeded rows and guess for tenant-created ones, so the
-- token is stored where the type is.
--
-- THE VOCABULARY IS LEGACY'S, NOT A BETTER ONE
--
-- Sizes 20' / 40' / 45'; types DC / HC / OT / FR / RF, plus TK / VT / BU for the
-- kinds legacy never had. That has one consequence worth stating: a 40' HC
-- REEFER prints `40'RF`, the same as a 40' standard reefer, because legacy's
-- five type codes cannot say both "high cube" and "reefer" at once. A file
-- carrying both prints `02*40'RF, 01*40'RF`. Distinguishing them would mean a
-- token legacy never emitted, and the whole point of matching byte-for-byte is
-- that an old file and a new file print the same way. A tenant who prefers the
-- distinction edits the token — that is why it is a registry value and not a
-- rule in code.
--
-- The size-less legacy rows (FLATRACK, OPENTOP, REEFER, …) get the bare type
-- code. Most were retired by 9092 in favour of sized variants, but a tenant who
-- priced a rate against one keeps it, and a retired type still has to print.
-- ============================================================================

-- Sized dry: the HC is part of the TYPE in legacy's vocabulary, not the size.
