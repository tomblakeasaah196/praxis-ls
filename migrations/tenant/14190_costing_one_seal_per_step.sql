-- TENANT DB — 14190 A costing carries ONE seal per step, never more.
--
-- ── WHY ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- A costing is sealed three times on its way through: ACKNOWLEDGED (raised),
-- REVIEWED_ACCEPTED (validated), APPROVED_DISPATCH (approved). The document
-- printed every seal on `costing:<id>` that was not revoked — and unlocking an
-- approved costing revoked nothing. So approve → unlock → re-approve printed
-- SIX seals (SBX-CST-2026-0001: the same three steps twice, identical content
-- hashes), and every further unlock would add three more.
--
-- The service now supersedes a costing's seals when it is unlocked (see
-- costing.service unlockTransition). This migration:
--
--   1. repairs existing rows: a seal signed before the costing's last unlock is
--      superseded, and of what remains only the NEWEST seal per step stays
--      live. Superseded = the revocation triple, never a delete — a printout
--      made before today must keep verifying, as "revoked", on the portal.
--   2. makes a second live seal for the same step on the same costing
--      impossible, with a partial unique index. COSTING only: other document
--      types can carry two parties signing for the same reason.

-- ── CORRECTED 28 Sep 2026 ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- The first version set revoked_at without revoked_by, and ck_sig_revocation
-- (10771) requires both or neither. It passed wherever there was nothing to
-- supersede and failed on smartls [sandbox], which held SBX-CST-2026-0001's six
-- seals; that scope rolled back and re-runs this file as it is now. The scopes
-- that already applied it had no rows to update, so the correction changes
-- nothing there — re-stamp them with
--   node scripts/db/mark-migration-applied.js --scope=live --file=tenant/14190_costing_one_seal_per_step.sql --all-tenants --rehash
-- (and --scope=sandbox for the tenants whose sandbox succeeded).
--
-- revoked_by is the person the supersession belongs to: whoever unlocked the
-- costing (1a) or signed the newer seal for the step (1b), falling back to the
-- superseded seal's own signer — all rows of app_user in THIS schema already.

-- 1a. Seals from before the last unlock.
