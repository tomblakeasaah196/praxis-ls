-- PLATFORM DB — 0108 the primary chat vendor is a choice, not a constant
--
-- Until now which AI vendor answered first was two lines in
-- `src/services/ai/llm.service.js` (`PRIMARY = "deepseek"`,
-- `FALLBACK = "gemini"`), so switching the deployment from DeepSeek to Gemini
-- meant a code change, a test update and a deploy. Everything else about the
-- vendors — key, endpoint, model, active — was already the platform's to set
-- in the console; the ORDER was the one thing it could not touch.
--
-- `is_chat_primary` marks the row the runtime tries first. `llm.service.
-- resolveChain` reads it on every call and puts that vendor at the head of the
-- chain with the default chain behind it as the fallback, so choosing Gemini
-- makes DeepSeek the fallback rather than leaving nothing behind it (audit B2).
-- No flagged row means the code default — exactly what every deployment ran
-- on before this file.
--
-- ONE primary, enforced by the database. A partial unique index over the TRUE
-- rows is the constraint "at most one row is primary" stated directly; two
-- flagged rows would make the runtime's choice depend on scan order.
--
-- DeepSeek is flagged as the incumbent so the console shows the primary the
-- fleet is actually on from the first render, not "none chosen" while every
-- turn still goes to DeepSeek. Guarded on no row being flagged yet, so a
-- re-run — or a deployment that chose before this file was applied — is not
-- overridden.
--
-- ── THE GEMINI ROW REPAIR ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- 0060 seeded `gemini` pointing at `…/v1beta` — Google's NATIVE endpoint, which
-- does not speak /chat/completions. `llm.service.looksLikeNativeGemini` has
-- flagged exactly this shape since audit B2 ("resolves but every call fails"),
-- and the tenant seed (0470) already carries the compat gateway `…/v1beta/
-- openai`; the platform seed, which is the one the runtime reads, never got
-- the same correction. As the FALLBACK that meant a DeepSeek outage degraded
-- to the stub instead of to Gemini. As a PRIMARY — which this file makes
-- possible with one click — it would mean every call fails. So the row is
-- repaired here, where the click is introduced.
--
-- The model is moved off `gemini-1.5-flash`, which Google has shut down; the
-- replacement is `gemini-2.5-flash` — a stable (GA) model with no shutdown
-- date announced, the same family (flash) and role (fast, cheap, vision-
-- capable) the seed intended. Vision (`vision.service`) reads the SAME row's
-- model and key through the Google SDK, not the endpoint, so this fixes CV
-- reading and document OCR on a stock deployment too.
--
-- Both repairs rewrite ONLY the exact seeded values. An operator who set a
-- different endpoint or model in the console made a decision, and a migration
-- that reverses a decision is a regression with a filename. 0060 itself is
-- not edited: it is applied and ledgered by sha256, and an edited applied
-- file is a fleet-wide content-drift alarm that repairs nothing.
--
-- Prices: `tenant/12744` seeded per-token prices for `gemini-1.5-flash`; the
-- 2.5 line is priced differently and the operator re-prices the row in
-- AI Control → Vendors. Not done here — a price guessed in a migration is a
-- wrong cost ledger with a filename.
