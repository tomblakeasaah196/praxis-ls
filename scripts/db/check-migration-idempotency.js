/**
 * Guard: every NEW migration is safe to run twice, and no APPLIED migration is
 * ever edited.
 *
 * ── THE INCIDENT ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Two migrations were written with the same number (`0090_a`, `0090_b`). One
 * was renamed to `0100_b` to resolve the collision. The next migrate run failed
 * with "relation already exists", "index already exists", "trigger already
 * exists".
 *
 * THE RENAME WAS THE CAUSE, NOT THE DDL. The ledger is
 * `public.schema_migration(scope, filename)` — keyed on the relative FILENAME
 * (see src/services/platform/migrator.js). Rename the file and the ledger stops
 * matching, so the migrator sees a brand-new migration and runs it against a
 * database that already has everything in it.
 *
 * That is worth stating plainly because it changes what "fix it" means:
 * idempotent DDL makes the SYMPTOM harmless, it does not remove the cause. Use
 * `scripts/db/mark-migration-applied.js` for a legitimate rename.
 *
 * ── WHY IDEMPOTENCY IS STILL WORTH ENFORCING ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Because a rename is not the only way a file gets re-run:
 *
 *   - A migration that fails PART WAY leaves the ledger row unwritten (the DDL
 *     and the row commit together — DATA 3.1), so the whole file re-runs after
 *     the fix. Every statement before the failure runs a second time.
 *   - `provision-tenant` applies the full set to a database that may already
 *     have some objects from a partial run.
 *   - CI applies the tenant set TWICE on purpose, to test the ledger.
 *
 * ── AND WHY IDEMPOTENCY IS ALSO A HAZARD, WHICH IS THE OTHER HALF ───────────
 *
 * `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` silently skips a table whose definition CHANGED.
 * That is not hypothetical here — audit DATA 3.3: `notification_preference` was
 * CREATEd in two files with different columns, both with IF NOT EXISTS, the
 * earlier one won, and `created_at` exists on no database despite 0472
 * declaring it. Nothing read the column, so nothing broke. That is exactly what
 * made it dangerous.
 *
 * So this gate does TWO things, and the second is what stops the first from
 * becoming a liability:
 *
 *   1. NEW migrations must be idempotent (rules below).
 *   2. BASELINED migrations must not change, byte for byte.
 *
 * Rule 2 is the drift guard. Once a migration has run somewhere, editing it
 * changes what a fresh database gets and NOT what an existing one has — the two
 * silently diverge, and `IF NOT EXISTS` guarantees nobody finds out. A changed
 * definition belongs in a NEW migration. Always.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS NOT RETRO-FITTED ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The 127 files that existed when this landed are baselined as-is, for the same
 * reason check-migration-reversibility.js grandfathers its own: rewriting a
 * migration that has already run in production is a bigger risk than the one
 * being fixed. `--report` lists which grandfathered files would fail, so the
 * backlog is visible rather than forgotten.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/db/check-migration-idempotency.js              # CI gate
 *   node scripts/db/check-migration-idempotency.js --report     # show backlog
 *   node scripts/db/check-migration-idempotency.js --update-baseline
 *
 * Exits 1 on any violation.
