/**
 * WS-S1 — create the PgBouncer auth_query lookup role and function.
 *
 * PgBouncer in transaction mode fronts one database per tenant, and WS-S2 gives
 * each tenant its own Postgres role. A static `userlist.txt` would therefore
 * have to be regenerated and the pooler reloaded on every provision and every
 * credential rotation — and the failure mode of forgetting is a tenant that
 * cannot authenticate, which looks exactly like a database outage.
 *
 * `auth_query` removes that coupling: PgBouncer asks Postgres for the
 * credential at connect time, so provisioning and rotation need to know nothing
 * about the pooler.
 *
 * WHY A SECURITY DEFINER FUNCTION RATHER THAN QUERYING pg_shadow
 *
 *   The naive auth_query reads `pg_shadow` directly, which only a SUPERUSER may
 *   do — so the lookup role would have to be superuser, and PgBouncer would be
 *   holding superuser credentials to answer "what is the hash for this one
 *   username". That is an enormous grant for a trivial question, and it is a
 *   credential sitting in a config file.
 *
 *   Instead: a SECURITY DEFINER function owned by the superuser, EXECUTE granted
 *   only to the lookup role, which is itself an ordinary NOLOGIN-adjacent
 *   account with no rights to anything else. The lookup role can resolve a
 *   username and do nothing more.
 *
 *   The function is also STRICT and revoked from PUBLIC, so it cannot be used
 *   as a credential-dumping oracle by any other role that happens to connect.
 *
 * IDEMPOTENT. Safe to re-run — it is how you rotate the lookup password.
 *

 *   PGBOUNCER_AUTH_PASSWORD=... node scripts/db/setup-pgbouncer-auth.js
