/**
 * Reconcile the migration ledger after a migration file is RENAMED.
 *
 * ── THE PROBLEM THIS EXISTS FOR ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `public.schema_migration(scope, filename)` keys on the relative FILENAME
 * (src/services/platform/migrator.js). So renaming a migration that has already
 * run — resolving a number collision, fixing a typo in a slug — makes the
 * ledger stop matching. The next migrate run sees a brand-new file and applies
 * it to a database that already has everything in it:
 *
 *     relation "error_event" already exists
 *     index "ux_error_event_sig" already exists
 *     trigger "trg_error_event_updated" already exists
 *
 * Idempotent DDL hides that, but it does not fix it — and it does nothing at
 * all for a file containing a seed INSERT or an `ALTER … ADD COLUMN` backfill,
 * which re-runs silently and wrongly. The honest fix is to tell the ledger the
 * file has already been applied, under its new name.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS NOT JUST AN INSERT ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Marking a migration applied WITHOUT running it is a loaded gun: do it to a
 * file that genuinely never ran and the schema is missing objects that
 * everything downstream assumes exist, permanently, with the ledger insisting
 * all is well. That is strictly worse than the error it was meant to silence.
 *
 * So this refuses unless it can SEE the migration's effects in the catalog. It
 * parses the object names the file declares (tables, indexes, types, functions)
 * and checks they are present. All present → the file has clearly run under a
 * different name, marking it is bookkeeping. None present → it has not run, and
 * you want `migrate`, not this.
 *
 * A partial match is the interesting case and it stops too: that is a
 * half-applied migration, which needs a human, not a flag.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/db/mark-migration-applied.js --scope=platform --file=platform/0100_b.sql
 *   node scripts/db/mark-migration-applied.js --scope=live    --file=tenant/0530_x.sql --slug=smartls
 *   node scripts/db/mark-migration-applied.js --scope=sandbox --file=tenant/0530_x.sql --slug=smartls
 *   node scripts/db/mark-migration-applied.js ... --all-tenants
 *   node scripts/db/mark-migration-applied.js ... --force     # skip the catalog proof
 *   node scripts/db/mark-migration-applied.js ... --rehash    # re-stamp sha256 after a
 *                                                            # correction (see markOne)
 *   node scripts/db/mark-migration-applied.js ... --dry-run
 *
 * ── SCOPES: THERE IS NO "tenant" SCOPE ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This docblock used to say `platform | tenant | tenant-seed | platform-seed`,
 * and only one of those four is real. `migrateTenantDb` (provisioning.service)
 * applies the tenant migrations ONCE PER SCHEMA and passes the SCHEMA NAME as
 * the scope:
 *
 *     for (const schema of ["live", "sandbox"])
 *       applyTracked(cli, files.tenantSchema(), { scope: schema, … })
 *
 * So a tenant migration is recorded twice, under `live` and under `sandbox`, and
 * `--scope=tenant` writes a row that NOTHING EVER READS. The script accepted it
 * and printed `recorded ✓`, so the operator re-ran migrate, got the identical
 * error, and had no way to tell the tool had done nothing useful.
 *
 * A tenant file therefore needs BOTH scopes marked, or the sandbox schema fails
 * on the next run even after live is reconciled. The valid set is asserted below
 * rather than documented and hoped for.

 * `path.relative` handed the migrator. Both halves of that were one bug seen
 * from two sides: the key was HOST-dependent, so a ledger written on Windows was
 * unreadable on Linux and the entire set re-applied.

 * `migrator.ledgerKey` now forces forward slashes on every platform, and this
 * has to agree with it. Normalising to native here would put the bug straight
 * back — on the one tool whose whole job is repairing the ledger.
