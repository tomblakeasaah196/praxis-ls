#   1. record what is currently running, so it can be rolled back to
#   2. back up the database (BEFORE migrations, which have no down path)
#   3. build new images, tagged with the commit
#   4. run migrations (additive by convention; old code keeps working mid-deploy)
#   5. restart the STANDBY api first and wait until READY
#   6. restart the PRIMARY api — nginx fails over to the standby (backup
#      upstream) for the few seconds it's down, then traffic returns
#   7. restart the worker (queue downtime is invisible to users)
#   8. verify READINESS, not just liveness

# CHANGED 2026-08-04 — audit TEST-D1 / TEST-D2 / OBS-I2 / OBS-I4 / TEST-R2.
#
# What this script used to do, and why each was a problem:
#
#   `docker image prune -f`   Ran on every deploy and deleted the previous
#                             image. The only artifact you could have rolled
#                             back to was destroyed by the very thing that might
#                             need rolling back. There was no rollback path at
#                             all — not a slow one, none.
#
#   no backup                 Migrations ran against production with no dump
#                             taken first, and there is not one down-migration
#                             in the repo (DATA 3.5). A bad migration was
#                             unrecoverable.
#
#   `curl /api/health`        The final gate. That endpoint returned {ok:true}
#                             unconditionally and never touched the database, so
#                             a container that could not reach Postgres passed
#                             the gate and the deploy printed "deploy ✓".
#
#   untagged images           Everything was `latest`; nothing identified which
#                             commit was running (TEST-R2).
#
# Rollback is now `bash scripts/rollback.sh`. Read that file before you need it,
# not while you need it.

# inode intact for anyone already reading it. So bash carries on executing the
# OLD deploy.sh for the rest of the run, and the version just pulled does not
# take effect until the NEXT deploy.
#
# This is not theoretical. On 2026-08-04 a fix to the backup step was pulled and
# the run failed with the exact bug that had just been fixed; the giveaway was
# that the error text was the old wording. Every previous change to this file has
# silently had the same one-deploy lag.
#
# Re-exec closes it: pull, then hand over to the new file. PREVIOUS_SHA is passed
# through the environment because after the pull `git rev-parse HEAD` is the NEW
# commit, and the whole point of that value is to name what we are replacing.
