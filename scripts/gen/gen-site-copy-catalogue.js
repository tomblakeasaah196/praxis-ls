/**
 * Generate the SITE COPY CATALOGUE — every word on the tenant website that a
 * tenant is allowed to rewrite, derived from the dictionary that ships it.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS EXISTS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `public-web/src/lib/i18n-dict.ts` holds ~465 strings under `site.*`, and
 * every one of them is a sentence a visitor reads on a white-label site: a
 * hero, a section heading, an empty state, a form label, a legal footer line.
 * They were real, visible, and written into a frontend bundle where no tenant
 * could reach them — "Success stories / Operations we have run, in our own
 * words" is the tenant's claim about the tenant's business, printed in words
 * we chose for them.
 *
 * `site_content` already carries the right model for fixing that: the
 * dictionary is the DEFAULT, a published block is the OVERRIDE. What was
 * missing is the LIST — an enumeration of what can be overridden, so an editor
 * can show a tenant the sentence they are about to change, in both languages,
 * beside the one we shipped.
 *
 * That list cannot be hand-maintained. A string added to the dictionary during
 * a feature would simply not appear in the editor, which is the exact failure
 * this closes, one string at a time. So it is DERIVED from the dictionary and
 * gated in CI: add a `site.*` string without regenerating and `build-test`
 * goes red, the same contract `generate-api-docs.js --check` holds for
 * `doc/API_REFERENCE.md`.
 *
 * ── WHAT "WHERE IT APPEARS" IS, AND WHY IT IS COMPUTED ────────────────────
 *
 * A tenant looking for "Success stories" is not looking for
 * `site.portfolioPage.titleMain` — they are looking for *the Our-work page*.
 * So each section records the PAGES it is read on, resolved by following the
 * `@/` import graph out of every route component in `app/router.tsx` and
 * collecting the `site.<section>` keys each one can reach. A shared band such
 * as the footer therefore reports every page that mounts it, and a section
 * that stops being used anywhere reports nothing — both facts read off the
 * code rather than off a comment.
 *
 * Usage:  node scripts/gen/gen-site-copy-catalogue.js [--check]
 *   --check  exit 1 if the committed catalogue differs from what the
 *            dictionary implies, without writing.
