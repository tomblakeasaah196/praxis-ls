/**
 * Generate the API reference and the error-code registry FROM THE CODE.
 *
 * Closes three findings that are all the same shape — a real part of the
 * contract that existed only in someone's head or in a prose comment:
 *
 *   API F-25  No API spec exists. The one artefact that did (a Postman
 *             collection) covered 137 of 731 routes and had already drifted.
 *             A hand-written spec would drift the same way, so this DERIVES the
 *             surface from `doc/api-contract.json`, which `check-api-contract.js`
 *             already produces from the mounted routers — the same artefact CI
 *             fails on. A spec that is generated cannot disagree with the code.
 *
 *   API F-23  61 routes run authMiddleware with NO requirePermission. They are
 *             legitimately self-scoped, and nearly all say so in a comment —
 *             but "self-scoped, no grant required" is a real access tier that
 *             was not expressible in the permission matrix, not visible to an
 *             administrator, and not discoverable by a consumer.
 *             `GET /appraisals/mine` and `GET /appraisals` differ enormously in
 *             who can call them and nothing declared it.
 *             NOT CLOSED HERE — see the note above renderApi. The contract JSON
 *             cannot distinguish the tiers, and a wrong tier table is worse
 *             than none.
 *
 *   API F-5   188 error codes with no registry, containing near-synonyms a
 *             consumer cannot switch on reliably (INVALID_AMOUNT vs BAD_AMOUNT;
 *             FORBIDDEN vs PERMISSION_DENIED vs NOT_YOURS). Publishing the list
 *             is additive and is the precondition for ever consolidating them —
 *             you cannot deprecate a code nobody has enumerated.
 *
 * Usage:  node scripts/generate-api-docs.js [--check]
 *   --check  exit 1 if the committed docs differ from what the code implies,
 *            so CI catches a route or code added without regenerating.

/**
 * NOT DERIVABLE FROM THE CONTRACT — and this is worth writing down.
 *
 * `doc/api-contract.json` records `auth`/`rbac` per route from the middleware
 * NAMES on that route's own stack. Almost every router applies auth once with
 * `router.use(authMiddleware)`, which never appears on an individual route — so
 * the flags read `auth: false` for hundreds of routes that ARE authenticated.
 *
 * A first version of this generator classified the tiers off those flags and
 * produced "713 public, 9 self-scoped", which is nonsense — the audit counted
 * 10 public and 61 self-scoped. Publishing that would have been the exact
 * failure this remediation keeps finding: a control described as working when
 * it is not, except here it would have been a SECURITY tier table that lied.
 *
 * So the tier section is not emitted. Deriving it properly needs static
 * analysis of the routes files (resolving router-level `use`), which belongs in
 * check-api-contract.js so that CI and this share one answer. F-23 stays open
 * until then; this file documents everything it CAN derive honestly.
