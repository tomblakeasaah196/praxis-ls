/**
 * The day-first gate — dates are dd/mm/yyyy, everywhere, forever.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS A BUILD GATE AND NOT A CODE-REVIEW HABIT ───────────────────
 *
 * Praxis serves the Cameroon / OHADA corridor, where a date is read day-first.
 * A month-first date is not a cosmetic slip: 03/07/2026 is a real date under
 * both readings, so nothing downstream ever throws, no test goes red, and the
 * screen looks perfectly fine to whoever built it. The defect surfaces four
 * months later as a licence that expired in a month nobody expected, a customs
 * deadline missed by a quarter, or a payroll run dated to the wrong period.
 *
 * That is exactly the shape of defect a gate is for — invisible to the author,
 * expensive to the operator, and re-introduced the moment attention lapses.
 *
 * ── AND WHY IT KEEPS COMING BACK WITHOUT ONE ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * Because the month-first version is what you get by DEFAULT, three times over:
 *
 *   1. `<input type="date">` renders in the operating-system locale. There is
 *      no attribute that overrides it — `lang` is ignored for the value
 *      display — so the control is month-first on a US-configured machine no
 *      matter what the app does. `DateField` exists for this, and this gate is
 *      what makes it the only option rather than the recommended one.
 *   2. `toLocaleDateString()` with no locale means "whichever locale this
 *      machine happens to have". In a container with no LANG that resolves to
 *      en-US, so SERVER-rendered dates were month-first too.
 *   3. `"en-US"` written out explicitly, usually copied from a snippet.
 *
 * ── WHAT IT FLAGS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   native-date-input    a native `type="date"` control
 *   floating-locale      an order-sensitive date format with no locale pinned
 *   month-first-locale   an order-sensitive date format pinned to en-US / en
 *   month-first-literal  the token MM/DD/YYYY written into code
 *
 * "Order-sensitive" is the whole precision of this gate. A format renders a day
 * NUMBER next to a month only when its options are absent (the default is
 * numeric d/m/y) or carry `day:` / `dateStyle:`. `{ month: "long" }` is a month
 * NAME with no order to get wrong, and flagging it would be noise — and a gate
 * that cries wolf gets switched off.
 *
 * ── THE TWO WAYS OUT, BOTH OF WHICH COST A SENTENCE ────────────────────────
 *
 * Some code legitimately handles a month-first date. It is always one of two
 * things, and each needs the marker that says which:
 *
 *   `@date-format:parts`   — `Intl.DateTimeFormat` built to call
 *                            `formatToParts()` and read named fields off it, or
 *                            to probe a timezone for validity. Nothing is ever
 *                            rendered, so the locale cannot reach a reader.
 *   `@date-format:foreign` — a date format that belongs to somebody ELSE's
 *                            file. A Cameroonian bank may well send a statement
 *                            in MM/DD/YYYY; refusing to parse it does not make
 *                            the statement day-first, it makes the import fail.
 *
 * Put the marker in a comment on the offending line or the line above it, with
 * a reason after it, exactly as `@silent:` markers work in doc/ERROR_HANDLING.md.
 * Whole files that exist to deal with foreign date formats are listed in
 * ALLOW_FILES below instead, each with its reason.
 *
 * Exits 1 on any violation. Wired into .github/workflows/ci.yaml and
 * `npm run ci` (scripts/ci-local.js).
